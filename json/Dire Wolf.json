    "description": "Dire wolves grew to about 9\u202ffeet (2.7\u202fmeters) long and weighed up to 800\u202flb (360\u202fkg), about the size of a horse. They had thick fur that was mottled grey or black in color, and they had eyes like fire.[3]Dire wolves were far more aggressive than normal wolves,[7] attacking and killing anything they could catch. They can be found singly as lone wolves or in packs numbering five to eight dire wolves.[3]They could generally be found in temperate forest environments,[3] such as the Starwood[10] the Silver Marches,[11] and the Toadsquat Mountains.[12] However some were occasionally encountered in colder environments, such as the North Country of Rashemen[13] or within some caves found throughout Icewind Dale.[14]Dire wolves were occasionally kept by hill giants,[15] members of the Gray Wolf tribe of the Uthgardt people,[16] and Black Blood cultists.[17] A leash and collar made for a dire wolf cost 8 sp from Aurora's Emporium, as of the mid\u201314th century DR.[18]They had keen senses, including a sharp sense of smell, allowing them to track their prey by scent. They could also move stealthily on the hunt.[3]Dire wolves fought in packs, fighting efficiently and surrounding their prey and flanking it to gain an advantage. Their bite was their only weapon, but they could drag a creature to the ground once they had gotten a hold of them.[3]In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Conner and a young boy were traveling on a moor when fog swept in and they were beset by starving dire wolves. However, before the beasts closed in for the kill, a shaft of moonlight transported them to Waterdeep.[20]",
