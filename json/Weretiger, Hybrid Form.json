  "special_abilities_desc": "The weretiger can use its action to polymorph into a tiger-humanoid hybrid or into a tiger, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. The weretiger has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. If the weretiger moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the weretiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action. ",
  "description": "  Large Humanoid (Human and Shapechanger)\nAlignment: Always neutral\nInitiative: +6 (+2 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative); Senses: low-light vision, scent, Listen +6, and Spot +6 Source: Monster Manual Lycanthropes in their natural forms use whatever tactics are favored by their people, though they tend to be slightly more aggressive. Lycanthropes in animal or hybrid form fight like the animal they resemble. Weretigers can assume a hybrid form as well as an animal form. In hybrid or tiger form, they can pounce and grab just as normal tigers do. Alternate Form (Su): A weretiger can assume a bipedal hybrid form or the form of a tiger. The bipedal form is about 7 feet tall, with a 3-foot tail, and covered by tiger-striped hide. The legs are more feline than human, and this form walks on its toes. The fingernails grow into claws. The head is a mixture of features: Ears, nose, muzzle, and teeth are tigerlike, but the eyes and overall shape are human. If the human form's hair is long, it is still present. The animal form is that of a fully grown tiger without any trace of human features. Pounce (Ex): Ifs weretiger in hybrid or tiger form leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action. Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability the weretiger in hybrid or tiger form must hit with a claw or bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can rake. Rake (Ex): A weretiger in hybrid or rigor form that gets a hold can make two rake attacks (+9 melee) with its hind legs for 1d8+3 damage each. If the weretiger pounces on an opponent, it can also rake. Skills: In hybrid or tiger form, weretigers receive a +4 bonus to Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8. A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype. Traits: A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).
