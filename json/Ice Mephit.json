Each creature within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary shard of ice. The mephit can innately cast fog cloud, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. ",
