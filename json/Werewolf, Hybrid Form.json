    "special_abilities_desc": "The werewolf can use its action to polymorph into a wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. The werewolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. ",
    "description": "  Medium Humanoid (Human and Shapechanger)\nAlignment: Always chaotic evil\nInitiative: +6 (+2 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative) ; Senses: low-light vision, scent, Listen +1, and Spot +1 Source: Monster Manual Lycanthropes in their natural forms use whatever tactics are favored by their people, though they tend to be slightly more aggressive. Lycanthropes in animal or hybrid form fight like the animal they resemble. Werewolves can assume a hybrid form as well as an animal form. In hybrid or wolf form, they can trip just as normal wolves do. Alternate Form (Su): A werewolf can assume a bipedal hybrid form or the form of a wolf. The bipedal form is about 6 feet tall, with a short tail, and covered in fur. The legs are like those of a wolf and the head combines humanoid and lupine features in degrees that vary from one werewolf to the next. The animal form is that fully grown wolf without any trace of human features. Trip (Ex): A werewolf that hits with a bite attack attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch attack a provoking an attack of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the opponent cannot react to trip the werewolf. Skills: A werewolf in hybrid or wolf form gains a +4 racial bonus to Survival checks when tracking by scent. A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype. Traits: A shapechanger possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature's entry).

    "caption": "Werewolves are a type of shape-changing monster in Faer\u00c3\u00bbn that are vulnerable to silver or magic weapons and can regenerate most wounds. Infected werewolves transform during the full moon involuntarily. Members of their race that are born with the curse can infect others and can control their shifting. Sel\u00c3\u00bbne has a group of non-evil werewolves that worship her, though most lycanthropes are drawn towards the worship of Malar. Werewolves are the most common type of lycanthropes in the world. They are found in all climates, both in the wild and hidden in civilization. Werewolf packs are organized similar to wolf packs, with a powerful alpha in command of the entire group. The moral and ethical outlook of the pack tends to follow that of the alpha."
