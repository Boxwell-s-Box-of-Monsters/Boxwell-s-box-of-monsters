    "description": "   Rats were generally cowardly creatures, but would become fierce if cornered or trapped. They feared fire, but if hungry enough could be driven to ignore this base instinct.[5] Rats thrived in urban environments where they could easily feed off the leftover food and waste of the community.[2] Deep in the Underdark near Menzoberranzan, scurry rats were hunted by riding lizards of the drow.[11] Beyond the Prime Material plane, rats could be found in the Domains of Dread.[12]",
