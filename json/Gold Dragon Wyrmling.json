I just made it so that when they find the three black eggs in the cave complex near greenest, one of them is only painted black and is actually gold. One of my characters wants to raise it. I have already found a way to tie it into the story. Any advice on raising the dragon wyrmling?I am running a interconnected campaign Forgotten Realms-Eberron a player, Fighter 6, has acquired a black-gold dragon egg and successfully hatched it. As it behaves as a chick normally does. Meaning it constantly eats or sleeps while visibly doubling in size daily. Required food will be expensive unless the PC has deep pockets or another ability to hunt/fish daily. Fortunately, for the wyrmling, the player speaks draconic and currently teaching the wyrmling both draconic grammar and Common. I made the party of a 1-shot campaign fight it and it TPK'd them.Is a dragon\u2019s alignment innate, like a fiend or celestial, or learned, like most humanoids? Like, if a evil-aligned villain gets ahold on a gold dragon egg and raises it, could this guy end up evil?Is a dragon\u2019s alignment innate, like a fiend or celestial, or learned, like most humanoids? Like, if a evil-aligned villain gets ahold on a gold dragon egg and raises it, could this guy end up evil? Yes it could. Demons are literally the embodiment of evil.If I had a 5 person party of 3rd level PCs fight it, would it be a TPK?Probably not, though they would have a scare from it's breath weapon it should be a fairly easy encounter so long as it is alone.Is a dragon\u2019s alignment innate, like a fiend or celestial, or learned, like most humanoids? Like, if a evil-aligned villain gets ahold on a gold dragon egg and raises it, could this guy end up evil? Yes it could. Demons are literally the embodiment of evil. But if it isn't innate, then how does a baby dragon even have an alignment in the first place?What makes this dragon a CR 3 and a Red Dragon Wyrmling CR 4?Generally a baby is raised by its parents, which hold the alignment. Parents tend to teach a baby by their moral code. So most gold wyrmlings will have the lawful good alignment. True. I overlooked that this has an intelligence of fourteen and so is smarter than the average human, therefore being smart enough to understand good and evil and which they support.So my lvl 3 monk with an insane homebrew item my dm accidentily gave to me has hatched one of these and uhh...

Seeing as it is already smarter than most average humanoids, give it a lesson in philosophy and see what happens lol This guy in his lair can banish the party's tank and then burn the wizardI am DMing the Hoard of the Dragon Queen campaign.
