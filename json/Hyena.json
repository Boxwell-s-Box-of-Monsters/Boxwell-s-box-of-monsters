    "description": "      Hyenas came in different varieties but commonly had stripes on their fur, weighing about 120 pounds (55 kilograms) and measuring a about a yard (meter) in length. Their fur coloration gave them an advantage when hiding within areas of tall grass.[3] Hyenas fought in packs and were intelligent enough to send some of the members to circle and flank their prey. They were capable of tripping with their sharp jaws.[3] Gnolls, unsurprisingly, had a strong affinity for hyenas, keeping many as pets or guards.[6] The Mulhorandi god Set also favored hyenas, using them as omens for his followers.[7] In the Shining South hyenas were known to be found in and around the Channath Vale, Dambrath, Durpar, Estagund, the Gnollwatch Mountains, the Great Rift, and the Shaar.[8] North of this region, they could be found wandering the Raurin desert.[9]",
