    "description": "Horses were classified in a number of different manners. Chargers, or more plainly warhorses were those horses bred to ride in battle.[9] Light warhorses were referred to as coursers while heavy warhorses were known as destriers.[10]Some of the best-trained horses were trained by the elven House Korianthil.[11]Horses were considered sacred to many faiths of Faer\u00fbn. Warhorses were important to followers of Anhur, the Red Knight, and Tempus. Pinto and piebald horses were particularly favored by Deneir; palomino horses to Waukeen. Gray-haired horsed were sacred to Mask, while white ones were sacred to Milil, and chestnut-colored horses to Sune. Mystra favored donkeys, horses, and mules with blue or mismatched eyes. Intelligent horses were also native to the celestial realms of Sehanine Moonbow.[12]Horses were a kind of novelty for Thymari dragonborn, as such beasts weren't common in Abeir. As such, horses, specially warhorses were highly valued by Thymari, who cared for them as precious friends.[13]A white horse was the symbol for the sun elf house of Evanara.[14]",
