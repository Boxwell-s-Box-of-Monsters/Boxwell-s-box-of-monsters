    "description": "   The undead form of skeletons was held by necromantic energy, which kept otherwise loose bones and joints together and conferred on the undead corpse a glimmer of vitality and rudimentary intellectual capabilities.[1] Although skeletons were most typically created from humanoid remains, many other varieties existed.[1] Bonecrusher A minotaur skeleton.

Edged and piercing weapons, such as swords and arrows, were mostly ineffective against skeletons; only blunt weapons, such as warhammers, were effective at knocking the bones apart. [3] Like other undead, skeletons could be repelled or destroyed outright by priests like paladins and clerics.[3] The necromantic spell animate dead allowed spellcasters to create skeletons.[16] They could also spontaneously rise in locations saturated with evil or necromantic powers.[1]",
