    "actions_desc": "The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's head, and the target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours. The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.\nWhenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.\nA duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears. ",
    "special_abilities_desc": "While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down). and that creature takes the other half. While the cloaker remains motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak. While in bright light, the cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. ",
    "description": "Cloakers communicated through a subsonic moan, inaudible to most creatures, that could travel up to 60\u201280\u202fft (18\u201224\u202fm).[1] They were capable of increasing the intensity of their moans as a defense mechanism, rendering them audible, and causing foes to feel a mixture of fear and nausea.[1][3] The highest intensity of this subsonic moan was capable of causing an effect akin to hold person on an individual with 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm). However, these sounds could not penetrate dense materials, such as stone.[4]Their minds and thoughts were so alien that it was said no one could communicate with them.[6]Some cloakers were known to be capable of manipulating the shadows around them, though a light spell would easily render them blind and incapable of using this ability.[4][3][2] Others expressed the ability to conjure up to three illusory duplicates of themselves that copied their movements, but could only do so in an area of darkness.[1][4]Cloakers generally either waited in ambush for their prey,[3] or stalked them from a safe distance.[1][2] Once an opportune moment presented itself the cloaker would unfurl its fins and attempt to engulf their prey within them. Once a cloaker had entrapped its prey in this manner, they would use their long whip-like tail to defend itself from any creatures that might try to intervene.[1][3]A well-fed cloaker on a steady diet of adventurers.Cloakers were generally reclusive creatures, though older ones were known to coerce small groups of humans, goblins, and drow into doing their bidding; however, derro and quaggoths were the most commonly seen servants of older cloakers. At times cloakers were even known to be worshiped by tribes as a sort of god.[2] On occasion, one or more cloaker lords would draw together a population of cloakers to form a city,[6] and despite their generally reclusive nature, cloaker communities were surprisingly social, with the creatures forming odd social cliques, castes, and roles for themselves. They appeared to greatly care about popularity, with the most popular cloakers being those which were larger, had darker coloration, or kept the most \"pets\" in the form of enslaved darkmantles, lurkers, or humanoids.[9]Cloakers did not venerate any deity.[10]Some believed that cloakers were related to creatures known as trappers. Scholars also believed that they may have been an asexual species, but there was no definitive proof of this[4] and cloakers had been observed to appear to court others of their kind within cloaker settlements.[9] It was known, however, that a cloaker lord was capable of spawning cloakers as a byproduct of their own asexual reproduction.[11]Cloakers\u2014or at least their ancestors\u2014were believed to have originated in the Plane of Shadow.[12] In Faer\u00fbn, many were known to inhabit the Underdark, either alone or in settlements like Cloakerhaven[9] or Rringlor Noroth,[13] though scholars believed that cloakers may have once built and inhabited the ruined Underdark city of Ikemmu.[14]Other cloakers were known to inhabit the Shadow Swamp, acting as warlords over lesser creatures in the plane of shadow such as the ghirrash and khumat.[15][16] Beyond that plane, they could be found in the Domains of Dread.[17]",
