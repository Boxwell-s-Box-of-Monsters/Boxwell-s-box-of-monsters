    "description": "Blood hawks were about the same size as a regular hawk with a large wingspan. They had speckled grey feathers. Their beaks and talons were strong and extremely sharp.[3]Male blood hawks hunted in groups called murders. Blood hawks were more vicious than other birds-of-prey. They possessed an insatiable desire for fresh blood. They were known to attack a target merely for the pleasure they gained from killing.[3][5]Blood hawks were very deadly opponents. They were very fast and maneuverable. They were stubborn fighters, continuing to attack a target even if they suffered injuries.[3]Evil bird maidens in Zakhara were known to shapeshift into blood hawks.[6]Male blood hawks often took gems from the corpses of their prey, which they used to decorate their nests to attract females.[3]Blood hawks were obligate carnivores and hunted humanoids, particularly humans. They got their name from their habit of consuming as much fresh blood as possible.[5]Outside of Faerun, blood hawks were known to be encountered in various deserts in Maztica.[7]Beyond the Prime Material plane, blood hawks could be found in the plane of Acheron.[8]Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",
