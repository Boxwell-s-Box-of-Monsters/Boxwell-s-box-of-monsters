    "description": "While they tended to be short-tempered and terse, androsphinxes possessed good-natured ideals and always attempted to do the right thing.[3]AD6 Strange Things Millionaires Do With Their Money, But Most of Us Have Never TriedBy The Penny HoarderAndrosphinxes were physically very powerful creatures and had terrifying,[5][3] deafening roars that could be heard from miles away that could inspire fear in other creatures to such a point that they would become momentarily paralyzed. Those standing within 3\u202ffeet (0.91\u202fmeters) were liable to be deafened and even knocked over if small enough.[5]These creatures had innate magical abilities,[3] with some being capable of casting clerical spells.[5]These creatures were typically capable of speaking both their own unique language and Common.[5][3][1] Some were also known to speak Draconic[3]Many andros shunned the company of their female counterparts, gynosphinxes, as they resented their greater intellects and neutral-dispositions.[5]Androsphinxes were favored monsters of the elven deities Aerdrie Faenya and Solonor Thelandira, the dwarven god Vergadain, the Mulhorandi god Horus-Re, and the god Nobanion. They would sometimes send them as messengers to their followers.[7]",
