    "description": "   Like ferrets, these animals were small, slender-bodied predators.[4] The various breeds of weasel ranged in length from 5 to 16\u202finches (0.13 to 0.41\u202fmeters) on the lower end,[3] measuring from head to tail, to 1 to 2\u202ffeet (0.3 to 0.61\u202fmeters) on the larger end of the spectrum.[6] Weasels could be extremely aggressive but chose to attack smaller prey.[2] In the land of Kara-Tur wild weasels could be found in its temperate forests, plains, and swamps. As well as in its more arctic regions.[7] These animals could be trained and domesticated.[4][5] And some wizards were known to have them as familiars.[8] Weasels were a favored animal of the deities Garagos, Garl Glittergold, and Thoth.[9] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",
