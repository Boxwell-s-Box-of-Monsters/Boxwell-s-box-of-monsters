    "description": "Baboons were known for being very territorial and would attempt to drive off any invaders. However, they generally would flee if met with determined resistance by their invaders.[4] Whenever they were threatened they would bark and howl.[5]These creatures lived in packs of ten to forty members, with two to eight large males acting as leaders.[4]Baboons lived in forested, mountainous, or plains regions with a tropical or subtropical climate.[3]They could be found all throughout the jungles of Chult.[7][8] In the Hordelands, numerous tribes of them lived within the Howling Gap and their howls were thought by some to be the mountain pass's namesake.[5]In east Zakhara, baboons could be found in the Grey Jungle.[9] And in the Crowded Sea of Zakhara, they could be found in the island chain of Nada al-Hazan[10] and the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan.[11]A baboon could be summoned by the conjure animals spell.[12]",
