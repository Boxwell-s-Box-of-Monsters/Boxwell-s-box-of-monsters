    "actions_desc": "The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked prone. The dragon turtle exhales scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage. ",

    "description": "This is a\nGood Article!Dragon turtles were distantly related to dragons and had dragon blood.[17] They appeared as huge turtle-like creatures with a long tail and neck with large, taloned flippers.[3] Their heads had a golden crest down the center.[5][3]The scales of a dragon turtle were generally smooth, but overtime becoming more coarse until finally being molted. By that time the scales had lost much of their durability.[18]The shell of a dragon turtle measured between 15 to 25\u202ffeet (4.6 to 7.6\u202fmeters) in diameter[3] and was strong enough to leave it almost impossible to harm.[6] The shells were streamlined with jagged protrusions.[3] The shell was often a shade of deep green, similar to the color of the ocean, with silver highlights running along the raised areas.[6][3] This meant that a surfacing dragon turtle was often mistaken for light reflecting on the water.[3]Due to the shell's immense strength, shields made from dragon turtle shells were exceptionally tough and had resistance to heat or steam attacks.[5] Their shells were also valued for use as book covers,[19] jewelry,[20] spell components,[21][22] furniture,[23] or as a building material.[23]Dragon turtles were aggressive and solitary creatures who would attack any ships and other dragon turtles that entered their territory.[5] Like true dragons, dragon turtles were obsessed with gold and treasure. They often attacked ships in order to loot the treasure. After sifting through the wreckage, the creatures would carry the valuables back to their lair in their mouths.[1] Sailors wishing to pass through the territory of a dragon turtle found that the creatures were intelligent enough to accept bribes or tributes.[5][7] Sometimes turtle dragons could even be bribed to fight for others, notably working with sahuagin raiders or powerful marids.[1] Some dragon turtles could even master powers of sorcery. Dragon turtle sorcerers were rumored to guard farm caverns in the Undermountain.[24][25][26]A dragon turtle attacks a ship.When in combat, dragon turtles would use their massive bulk to slam into enemies. Dragon turtles were capable of capsizing even large vessels.[6][1][3][5] Dragon turtles could also expel a blast of scalding steam from their mouths.[6][1][3][5]A dragon turtle guarded a vast territory that could expand up to 50\u202fsquare miles (130,000,000\u202fsquare meters). Other dragon turtles were only permitted to enter the territory of another during mating season.[5] Dragon turtles lived in vast caves under the seafloor[5] or hidden in coral reefs.[1] These lairs were used to store their treasure hoards.[5]Dragon turtles were carnivorous and would eat almost anything in order to satisfy their appetite, even other dragon turtles. If food was in particularly short supply, dragon turtles were known to hunt sea birds using their steam breath attack.[5]Dragon turtles generally spoke Aquan,[3][1] Draconic,[6][14][3][1] and sometimes Common.[3]High quality dragon turtle scales, those which had not been naturally molted, were highly valued for the production of armor that was both durable and flexible.[18]As of 1358 DR, a dragon turtle had been floating off the coast of T'u Lung for 20 years. The creature was immense even by dragon turtle standards and was often mistaken for an island. Due to its immense size, it did not see ships as a threat, and when disturbed, it simply left for a better spot to rest.[27]In 1369 DR, the corpse of a young dragon turtle washed up on the shore of the Deepwash. The body attracted scavengers and spoiled fishing in the Deepwash for months.[28] The juvenile was killed by another far older and larger dragon turtle whose territory spanned most of the deepwash.[11]In 1371 DR, a Red Wizard Brazhal Kos developed a successful method of enslaving dragon turtles that were inhabiting Lake Thaylambar in large numbers. Thay was trying to cull the dragon turtle population for years before and after the story of Brazhal's successes spread. The number of hunters on the lake increased dramatically after that, even though many of them died in the process.[29][8] The number of aspiring fishers remained high for a few years that followed. The fishermen could easily be spotted by their unusual gear, nets, and huge hooks, big enough to catch a dragon turtle.[29]In 1372 DR, it was rumored that the harbormaster of Port Nyanzaru paid tribute to a dragon turtle to keep all other sea monsters away.[30]In 1487 DR, Nanna-Sin was resurrected and took the form of a dragon turtle. He then went to protect Djerad Kethendi against the forces of Unther.[31][32]Aremag breaks the surface to collect tribute from a sailing vessel.In Velen, hanging over the hearth at Morgan's Inn was the head of a dragon turtle that was slain by Captain Morgan. The inn had gained fame for this gruesome trophy and the ghost of the sea captain who still resided at the tavern.[38]Linnorms: Corpse tearer \u2022 Dread \u2022 Stygian\nDrakes: Ambush \u2022 Black firedrake \u2022 Dragonne \u2022 Elemental (Earth \u2022 Fire \u2022 Ice \u2022 Magma \u2022 Ooze \u2022 Smoke \u2022 Water) \u2022 Felldrake (Crested \u2022 Spitting) \u2022 Greater \u2022 Guard \u2022 Mind \u2022 Portal \u2022 Rage \u2022 Space \u2022 Vulture",
