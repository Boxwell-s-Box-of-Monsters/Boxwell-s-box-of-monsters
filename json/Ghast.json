    "description": "They resembled very closely their undead cousin,[2][3][5] except perhaps being just a bit more slender and ghost-like. The stench of death and rot lingered around their undead forms.[2] This stench could often be smelled from a 10\u202fft (3\u202fm) radius and was terrible enough to cause nausea, retching, and in rare cases even paralysis.[5][3]Like most undead, ghasts were immune to mind-affecting spells such as charm and sleep. Though they were known to be especially vulnerable to weapons made of cold iron.[5][3]Ghasts were also far more deadly and cunning than ghouls, with their paralytic touch dangerously affecting their opponents, except elves. [2]Much like ghouls, ghasts were typically encountered around graveyards.[3]Much like ghouls, ghasts spoke whatever language they did in life.[2][5]Ghasts often laired with others of their own kind or acted as the leaders of a group of normal ghouls.[2][3]When it came to non-undead creatures, ghasts were often enslaved to demons.[5] Some ghasts acted as servants of the deity Kiaransalee.[6]",
