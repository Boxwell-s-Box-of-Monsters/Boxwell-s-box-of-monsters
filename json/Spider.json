    "description": "   A large number of hand-sized venomous spiders would sometimes group themselves into a swarm.[3] Two adventurers about to get ensnared by giant spiders. Spiders inhabited the forest known as the Neth Stand.[20] Adhe Wood in the Vast was infested with ettercaps and mutant spiders of many sizes and breeds.[21] Spiders were common in the Underdark, particularly in drow settlements, where they were revered by worshipers of Lolth.[22] Drow often made objects and buildings in the shape of spiders.[23][24] In cultures that venerated Lolth, it was forbidden to kill a spider; those who did so were punished with death.[25] Spiders were often kept by the drow, their purpose depending on a given spider's size. The smallest ones were kept as pets by children. Those that were big enough to kill mice, meaning hand-sized, were kept as familiars by wizards. Those that were as big as a horse were used to ride upon. Those that were the size of dogs were used like guard dogs in temples to Lolth. The last category were sometimes imbued with a demon to make older ones regain their vitality, combining it with a nasty personality.[26] Spriggans in the Feywild were sometimes known to use spiders to create web barriers in their forests.[27]",
