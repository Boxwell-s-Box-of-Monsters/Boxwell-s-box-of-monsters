    "description": "       Mammoths were enormously sized beasts, much larger than other elephants,[4][5] standing as tall as 15\u202ffeet (4.6\u202fmeters) at the shoulder and weighing in at 9 to 11\u202ftons (8,200 to 10,000\u202fkilograms).[3] Their tusks were extraordinarily long,[1] sometimes as long as the creature was tall,[3] and weighing on average 50% more than the tusks of a standard elephant.[6][4][5] All mammoths were covered in thick, woolly hair[4][5][1] that was brown and shaggy.[3] An adult mammoth could easily carry 3\u202ftons (2,700\u202fkilograms) of weight and could be compelled to carry even as much as 8\u202ftons (7,300\u202fkilograms)! A single beast was strong enough to drag 40\u202ftons (36,000\u202fkilograms).[3] Mammoths were surprisingly intelligent animals,[6][4][5][3] even exhibiting some higher-level emotions and customs, such as paying special respect to the bones of their dead, returning often to visit sites where fellow herd members have died, sometimes repeating such a pattern for years in the case of a mate, sibling, or calf.[3] Mammoths were usually calm creatures but became extremely aggressive if threatened,[6][3] far much more so than elephants.[4][5] They defended their young and had exceptional memories of previous aggressors, attacking creatures that had tried to harm them or their offspring in the past.[3] If given the option, mammoths preferred to fight with their herd and not in isolation, though a larger bull male might be an exception.[3] In general, they fought like elephants,[6] by charging, goring, stomping, and trampling.[1][3] If a mammoth caught a victim in its tusks, it often tossed that creature through the air.[3] The largest mammoths lived out in the open steppes, where they had little to fear, because of their massive size.[3] They organized into large herds,[4][5][3] led by the oldest female member, along with her sisters and daughters.[3] The male mammoths were the fighters who defended the herd.[3] They preferred to live in cold, subarctic climates,[4][5][1][3] such as the High Ice[9] and Sossal,[11] but could survive in many climates, even subtropical ones.[1] In fact, mammoths were common in the Shining Plains of the Vilhon Reach.[7][8] Mammoths, like other elephant species, were herbivores.[6][5][1] The ivory from mammoths was more expensive than that from other elephants.[6][4][5][12][13] It was possible to train a mammoth for use as a mount or pack animal, but this had to be done from a young age, because an adult animal would starve itself rather than submit to a trainer. Such training typically took at least six weeks.[3] During the time of the Empire of Netheril, a tribe of orcs known as the Icebeast orcs were skilled at taming and training such creatures as woolly mammoths and remorhaz.[9] In the same era, the Rengarth tribe relied heavily on the presence of mammoths in their land, using them both as a source of food and as beasts of burden. The Netherese believed that the affinity the Rengarth had for the mammoths was a form of magic (but in truth, the Rengarth hated all forms of magic).[14] In 1364 DR, Dwahvel Tiggerwillies claimed to have \"larger ears than a Sossalan mammoth\" in regards to her information-gathering skills.[11]",
