        "description": "Aboleths were fish-like amphibians of immense size, often reaching 20\u202ffeet (6.1\u202fmeters) in length and weighing up to 6,500\u202fpounds (2,900\u202fkilograms),[10][9] though they continued to grow as they aged and some fantastically ancient specimens might reach 40\u202ffeet (12\u202fmeters) in length.[11] They resembled a bizarre eel, with long, tubular bodies, as well as a tail at one end and two fins near the head and another along the back. Aboleths' mouths were lamprey-like, filled with serrated, jawless teeth.[9]Aboleth underbellies were often orange-pink, while their topsides were typically sea-green. A little bit back from the head were four long tentacles, two sprouting from across each other on the top, and two more of the same on the underbelly. Their heads were roughly triangular-shaped, with a spherical, somewhat beak-like nose. Above the nose were their three eyes, each one set atop the other. Tendrils and a few shorter tentacles dangled from the bottom of the head. Four blue-black slime-secreting orifices lined the bottom of their bodies.[9] Aboleth blood was green and thick, oozing like sap.[12]Aboleths breathed through a thick gray mucus-like substance, which covered their body and which they exuded from four pulsating organs along their body as they moved.[10] If robbed of the ability to exude this slime, an aboleth would suffocate in water or on land alike. As such, an aboleth had to take care of its mucus. Out of the water, an aboleth's membrane-like skin dried out quickly, but this did not prove fatal in and of itself. Instead, the aboleth would eventually enter a state of suspended animation, called long dreaming, a fate considered far worse than simply dying amongst aboleths. During this process, the so-hampered aboleth formed a tough, waterproof membrane. However, if this membrane was pierced, liquid flooded out and death was usually not far off for the aboleth.[13]Aboleths did not die of old age and so lived on indefinitely, barring violence or disease.[13]Aboleths had powerful psionic powers and were natural psions like mind flayers and many other denizens of the Far Realm. However, aboleths had a much more fearsome ability, the capacity to secrete a viscous gray fluid, much like mucus, which brought about a terrible transformation in air-breathing creatures so unfortunate as to be caught in the fluid. The skin of the victim was transformed into a membrane that allowed it to breathe in water, and changed the creature's consciousness to that of a mindless servant. This allowed aboleths to keep slaves, known as aboleth servitors, which they dominated and kept captive through their mind. Only the most powerful aboleths could do this, however, completing the process through a powerful ritual.[14]Another strange feature of aboleths was their memory. An aboleth was born with a racial memory, each individual inheriting the memories of its ancestors. Furthermore, it assimilated the memories of those it consumed. Each aboleth's memories were stored within an ever-growing part of its brain that extended down its back as it aged. Aboleths enjoyed spending time lost in particularly fine memories of their ancestors, and if they had nothing better to do, they might relive entire portions of their forebears' lives.[9]Aboleths were all hermaphroditic, possessing both male and female reproductive organs. When aboleths bred, they did so in private, laying roughly one to three eggs once every five years. When laid, the eggs gestated for the same five years before hatching into fully functional aboleths. Although these young aboleths are functionally adults, they typically remained with their parent for roughly a decade, obeying the elder aboleth without question before setting out on their own. [10]Aboleths were both extremely cruel and highly intelligent. As a result, they were among the most dangerous foes that existed in the multiverse. Holders of many terrible secrets thanks to their unique genetic memory, aboleths were born fully aware and with all the memories of their ancestors, making even the youngest aboleth a frighteningly deadly predator. They were well aware of their weaknesses, however, and would not attack land-bound foes if they considered it to their disadvantage.[10]Aboleths were utterly self-centered as a race; they knew they were among the first beings in existence, and saw all things as theirs, having a particular loathing for land-dwelling creatures.[10] They were greatly unsettled by the similarly powerful mind flayers, in part because they lacked knowledge of the race's precise origins.[15]Wholly alien but dangerously intelligent, aboleths were among the most powerful creatures in all of the known multiverse and, although often removed from human affairs, they did not hesitate at any point to kill or use any unfortunate mortals who crossed their path.[14]Aboleth society was utterly alien in many ways to that of more familiar races, in part due to the racial memory all aboleths exhibited as well as their generally bizarre psyches. Some aboleths formed clusters known as \"broods\", ruled over by powerful \"overseers.\" These broods were often accompanied by aboleth servitors or other minions, such as the kuo-toa who were known to sometimes serve the race.[16]Aboleths had no gods that they worshiped. While they acknowledged the presence and power of gods, they had memories of a time long before any modern gods were worshiped and recalled such gods' birth and often demises within their own lifetimes. They were not concerned with an afterlife since their perspective on death was to consider it a failure and they intended to live forever. Aboleths did, however, have a certain respect that sometimes approached reverence for the powerful beings known as elder evils.[17]Aboleths used the term boorm (meaning \"flow\") to indicate a period of time.[18]An aboleth in Menzoberranzan attacking with its tentacles.Like most aberrant creatures, aboleths were originally from the Far Realm, though long ago many of them emigrated from the distant plane to the Prime Material Plane, where they settled in the Underdark. There, the vast majority of Toril's aboleths dwelled, though they could be found elsewhere, most commonly haunting ruins, deep lakes, or old temples. In some of these places, the kuo-toa foolishly served them.[14]Aboleth cities were vast affairs of bizarre and alien architecture, located deep underwater.[19] The Shape of Water, located in the Underdark's Glimmersea, was a notable aboleth fortified settlement.[20]Aboleths originally came to Toril when the world was young. The ancient obelisk-shaped city of Xxiphu plummeted to the world and settled deep in the earth's crust, below what was later the Sea of Fallen Stars. The oldest known aboleth and possibly the progenitor of the entire species, the Eldest, was an enormous creature that rested atop the city like a throne. The ancient aboleths of Xxiphu formed an organization called the Abolethic Sovereignty. Before 1479 DR, they were roused from a period of hibernation that spanned millennia, and the city of Xxiphu rose above the Sea of Fallen Stars[21] and conquered territory for the Sovereignty.[22]Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.\nAboleth article at the Critical Role Wiki.\nAboleth article at the Eberron Wiki, a wiki for the Eberron campaign setting.",

Physically, they were most distinguished by their horns, which protruded from the sides of their heads and wrapped around, projecting forward. A large frill adorned the upper part of the neck. They smelled like rotting vegetation and foul water. A black dragon grew up to a maximum size of 16\u202ffeet (4.9\u202fmeters) tall, 85\u202ffeet (26\u202fmeters) in length, with a wingspan of 80\u202ffeet (24\u202fmeters). They weighed up to 160,000\u202fpounds (73,000\u202fkilograms).[11]Solitary and extremely territorial in their nature, black dragons would seldom form clans, opting to do so only when they lived in the most hazardous of environments or when faced with a danger that could wipe out large swaths of their population.[9]Black dragons preferred ambushes to straightforward fighting.[8]A review of black dragon anatomy.Black dragons breathed a stream of acid.[5][4]Black dragons lived in swamps, jungles and fetid marshlands.[10] They were cunning creatures who lived to inspire fear and rule by intimidation. The black, glossy scales of black dragons added to their camouflage within swamp lands. They preferred to ambush their targets, using darkness or water as their cover. They were excellent swimmers and often made their lairs in submerged caves or underground chambers near swamps or murky ponds. Their lairs always had two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp or pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth.[12]Female dragons took the lead when it came to breeding, choosing their mate largely based on the size of the hoard of prospective males. Because of this, male black dragons would often brag about their accumulated wealth to communicative creatures or others of their own kind, in the hopes that rumors of their hoard would spread to any females in the area that were looking to mate. When two or more females selected the same male as their partner, they would fight for dominance high in the air above the lair of the male, allowing him to gaze upon his future mate's victory in admiration.[9]Black dragons were not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them personally. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while growing, which helped protect the dragon as well.[13] Black dragons would only protect their young so long as that responsibility didn't threaten their own life. If they had to choose between saving their own life or those of their clutch or spawn, they would most certainly choose the former; though they would assuredly seek revenge afterwards.[9]Black dragon wyrmling.A black dragon's diet consisted of fish, mollusks, aquatic critters and some red meat from terrestrial animals.[12]The skies over the southwestern Bay of Chessenta and southern Chondalwood have been the source of multiple sightings of black dragons. Reports from the jungles of Chult of dense, multi-layered tropical forest complete with its own ecosystem, were highlighted with tales of black dragons living within the canopy.[10]The iconography of the Purple Dragon Knights of Cormyr stemmed from the legend of the great black dragon Thauglor, who once dominated the area upon which the kingdom was built.[14]Black dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and were seen as good omens by his followers.[15]A black dragon demonstrating its acid breath.Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

The neck is short and broad, with spines growing from it. The tail is thick and bumpy, like that of a crocodile. The wings are more pronounced than most other species'. They smelled like electricity or sand.The blue dragon excelled at aerial combat, perhaps more so than any other species of dragon. Their lightning discharges were very easy to aim at other aerial foes, or at creatures below them on the ground. They were also extremely adept at burrowing in sand, and often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they were so burrowed, their large horns could easily be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.Blue dragons used a shocking burst of lightning.Blue dragons were native to arid wastelands and deserts. They made their lairs in underground caves; easily accessible to the dragons, as they could burrow through the ground. These dragons would fly above their territory, using the bleak landscape and its sparse terrain features as their best chance of spotting opponents. The typical blue dragon lair was dug into one of the towering rock formations that dominate desert landscapes. As with all dragon lairs, the blue dragon's lair would have two entrances: one at ground level and hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it could perch and survey its territory. Each lair also had a large subterranean cavern with a large pool of water and a sandy beach, which its inhabitant would use for drinking and relaxation.Despite their evil nature, blue dragons were actually excellent parents to their young, and would rarely leave their eggs unattended. Blue dragon eggs must be buried in warm sand to incubate. Blue wyrmlings were actually quite cute, but they were quick to taunt any other creature, and even quicker to hunt small desert creatures for food.Blue dragon WyrmlingChromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

From below, its outstretched wings formed a triangular shape, as they were attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings were longest at the shoulder, and tapered gently as they reached the tail. Their scales seemed to radiate heat and light. As their name implied, brass dragons tended to have brass-colored scales. Their scales were a dull brown at a young age, becoming more glossy and brass-like in appearance as they aged. The shape of the head was quite unusual, as it included a large, curved plate that extended from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and curved upwards into two points. They had two sharp horns on the chin, which became steadily pointier as the dragon aged. They smelled like metal.[6]Brass dragons very rarely engaged in combat, preferring to talk rather than fight. If they considered a creature threatening, they would subdue it with their sleeping gas. In the face of true danger, a younger brass dragon would have most likely flown away and hidden in the sand. It would have fought and used its fire breath only as an absolute last resort. Older brass dragons preferred to avoid combat but would fight if they had the tactical advantage[7]Brass dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a narrow line of fire, and the second was a cone of sleep gas.[5]Brass dragons hunted their prey while flying, mainly consuming antelope, mountain goats and sheep. Only evil brass dragons hunted intelligent creatures. Brass dragons have evolved for living in the desert and therefore can go long periods without water.[8]A stuffed young brass dragon was kept in the Obstacle Course level of Undermountain.[9]Brass dragons were native to arid regions; they shared many similar habitats with blue dragons, which often led to conflict. The brass dragon preferred to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also preferred to have the bulk of their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun would warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon's lair was well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders.[6] The centerpiece of any brass dragon's lair was the Grand Conversation Hall, where it spent the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. A typical lair also contained an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon collected, a sleeping chamber, and a storage room. All brass dragon lairs had several small entrances, known as bolt holes. These multiple entrances allowed a brass dragon to easily escape an attack by a blue dragon or other predator.[citation needed]Brass dragon eggs were incubated in a nest of open flames. Incubation took approximately 480 days.[10] The eggs were typically tended by both parents, so that they could talk together as they maintained their vigil. The newly hatched brass wyrmling was not remarkable in appearance; its scales were a dull brown. The scales became lighter and more brilliant as the dragon matured. Brass wyrmlings probably learned to talk more quickly than the young of any other sapient species. They talked constantly about anything and everything, and they would talk to anybody: friends, family, enemies and small creatures that could not talk back, or even to itself if nobody else was near. When exposed to a new language, a brass wyrmling would usually become fluent in under an hour.[citation needed]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "A review of bronze dragon anatomy.Physically, the bronze dragon was quite fierce in appearance, despite its good nature. While most of its body was a reflective bronze color, the wings were often tipped with green. The dragon had four large horns on each side of their heads, three protruding from each cheek and one from the top of their head, pointing back towards the tail. The tips of these points were black and very sharp, and were often used for grooming. The tongue was purple-gray, long and pointed, and not forked. A large frill ran down the upper part of its neck.[citation needed]Bronze dragons smelled like sea spray.[6]These dragons possessed the ability to alter their form, assuming the appearance of any type of animal or humanoid creature they choose. As such, many could have encountered a bronze dragon without ever being the wiser. A friendly dolphin that saved a drowning child; a mercenary sailor eager to fight pirates; a diver specializing in searching undersea shipwrecks for possible treasure\u2026 all of these could have been a bronze dragon. Many bronze dragons would use their shape-shifting abilities to get close to an enemy target; bronze dragons prefer melee combat.[citation needed]Bronze dragons could speak with animals, create food and water, make fog, control water and weather, and detect thought.[citation needed]While bronze dragons were often fascinated with battles, especially fighting to defeat evil, they had strong moral compunctions against killing living beings unless absolutely necessary. They would often join good-aligned armies to fight the forces of evil, either in human form or their own. In battle, their weapon of choice was to breathe repulsion gas, which is so putrid that it forced absolutely everything away. They also liked to relocate a foe to a remote location where it could do no harm when possible. When absolutely forced to kill, the bronze dragon was a deadly combatant, roasting enemies with bursts of lightning or ripping them open with its clawed forelegs.[citation needed]Bronze dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of electricity similar to a lightning bolt, and the second was either a cone of gas that affected the minds of creatures caught in it, causing them to flee for a short time,[7] or a cone of repulsion energy which physically pushed enemies away.[1]They truly enjoyed observing and interacting with smaller creatures, most especially humans. They often went out of their way to help them, such as rescuing humans from a shipwreck or a dangerous foe. In many of these instances, the bronze dragon would transform itself into a human, so that those who it helped never knew who really did the rescuing. They would never seek payment for their help, in any form. They always sought justice as best they could, and could not abide to see any creature being treated with cruelty of any sort. The older the dragon, the more pronounced the passion for justice became. They were probably the most social species of dragon, and often swam and played together in groups. They also loved to attend human festivals and parties, although usually in human form. The bronze dragons were spiritually connected to silver dragons as they have similar personalities and were each involved in an ancient ritual.[citation needed]Bronze dragons were often found along the coastal regions of the world. They liked to dwell along the sea, to make use of their aquatic abilities, while staying close to humanoid settlements. Many ship merchants would pay a bronze dragon to protect their trade routes. More nefarious bronze dragons would demand bribes for \u201cprotection\u201d while accepting similar bribes from pirates to operate within their territories. Given its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair was quite naturally underwater, and was often disguised with seaweed and coral. The bulk of the lair was above water level, however, consisting of multiple tunnels and large chambers, some as much as a thousand feet above sea level. They preferred to make their lairs in an island volcano, if possible.[citation needed]A bronze dragon wyrmlingBronze dragons mated for life, and took their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness. They protected their eggs and their wyrmlings at any cost. Although bronze dragons always lived near water, they laid their eggs in a dry cave. Apart from a dry, relatively warm environment, bronze dragon eggs required no special conditions for incubation like those of most dragons. Upon hatching, the wyrmlings were raised, taught, and protected by their parents. A newly-hatched bronze wyrmling appeared yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales gradually shifted to bronze as it matured. Bronze wyrmlings loved to swim in the ocean, and frolic in much the same manner as dolphins.[citation needed]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "Copper dragons had short faces, with features that included cheek ridges that pointed backwards, as well as frills on the back of their lower jaws. Their long segmented horns started as smooth brow plates above their eyes that extended backwards. From their chins, layers of triangular blades grew downward, growing more numerous as they aged. Combined together, those features gave copper dragons a pensive look. As they aged, their pupils faded away until their eyes acquired an appearance of glowing turquoise.[1][7]Their wings were manta-like, mottled with red and green discolorations near the end. They were supported at the front by relatively short articulated alar limbs that gave them a characteristic U shape when viewed from below, as well as spines that ran the wings' length to the back, at an angle from the backbone.[7]Newly hatched copper dragons had brown scales with a metallic tint, which grew coppery and glossy in color as the dragon aged. The scales of very old copper dragons acquired a green shade.[1][7]Copper dragons gave off a stony scent.[7]When it came to open battle, copper dragons were formidable fighters.[8]Copper dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of powerful acid, and the second was a cone of gas that slowed anyone within it.[3]A review of copper dragon anatomy.Copper dragons were usually even-tempered and sociable. They were well known for playing pranks and telling jokes and riddles. They enjoyed a good joke, riddle, funny story, or any form of good humor or wit, but became annoyed if someone didn't laugh at a joke that they made or take their pranks well. These habits made them especially fond of bards, and they appreciated their company enough that they were sometimes willing to set aside a temporary separate space for them in their lairs so they might provide entertainment.[1]However, they could also be greedy, envious, and stingy, and particularly dangerous when their treasure hoards were at threat. Nevertheless, good companionship was just as much a treasure to them.[1]A copper dragon's lair was usually found in rocky, dry uplands and hilltops, created inside narrow caverns within them. False walls could be created by the dragon in the lair to hide secret chambers and their most treasured items. Other things that were worthless to the copper dragon were placed away from the main hoard in order to tease treasure-seekers. In their main hoard, copper dragons kept precious ores, artworks, and curios that they had accumulated over their long lifetimes.[1]Copper dragons were often found in the service of the deities Brandobaris, Erevan Ilesere, and Vergadain.[9]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "This is a\nGood Article!A review of gold dragon anatomy.A gold dragon's head was characterized by a short face with long and smooth metallic horns that swept back from its nose and brow, as well as the neck frills that adorned both sides of its neck. From the mouth and nostrils descended four pairs of long, flexible muscular spines that resembled whiskers or barbels. Along with the dragon's narrow eyes, these features contributed to give them a look of sagacity. As the dragon aged, its pupils faded away until the eyes acquired an appearance of shiny, liquid gold. Other facial features included a pointed tongue and small cheek horns that grew sideways.[1][9][10]Gold dragons had broad sail-like wings[note 1] that started from their shoulders and extended all the way to the end of their extremely long tails. During flight, the wings moved in a graceful rippling motion that resembled swimming. This elegant flying motion was considered by many scholars, as well as by the gold dragons themselves, to be the most graceful among true dragons. When on the ground, the wings were kept closed upright over its back if the dragon was at rest, or folded facing back if the dragon was walking or running.[1][9]A newly hatched gold dragon had dark yellow scales dotted with metallic specks that increased in size with age, until they totally covered the scales, giving a shiny and radiant golden color to the adult dragon's entire body.[1][9][10]Despite being capable of eating almost anything, gold dragons tended to hunt large and dangerous monsters[10] and were particularly fond of including pearls and gems in their diet. Older dragons even had the ability to supernaturally locate gems in their vicinity. They tended to receive such gifts well, except if they were given as bribes.[1][4]Gold dragons could breathe underwater.[1][4] They gave off scents of saffron and incense,[9] and sometimes a faint smell of molten metal.[10]A gold dragon teaching a human.It was common for gold dragons to appoint themselves with quests to promote good. Those that earned a gold dragon's fury found a relentless enemy who would not rest until the utter and complete subjugation of the evildoers. Either by slaying or by bringing villains to justice, a gold dragon's only acceptable outcome was complete victory over evil.[9]When looking for a lair, gold dragons usually sought secluded and remote locations. They had a preference for idyllic or picturesque locations, such as rivers or the bottom of lakes, cave complexes, ancient ruins, deep gorges, high plateaus, or mist-covered islands.[1][9] They also had a preference for rolling hills, open plains, and in some rare cases even within humanoid communities which they have chosen to protect.[10] They were very private creatures, mostly keeping to themselves and their families and rarely fraternizing with other dragons.[1]Older gold dragons were capable of shapeshifting into humanoid or beast forms. They usually spent most of the time in this form, even within their lairs. When traveling, it was common for a gold dragon to assume a particularly non-threatening form in order to put adventurers at ease, as well as to observe local communities and to catch up on gossip and news of the outside world. In many cases, the dragon would use its disguise to provide help, company and comfort to those in need, or to set up traps for evildoers by using itself as bait.[1][9]Strong believers in the greater good and in the rule of order, gold dragons were sometimes viewed as arrogant and dismissive. They tended to avoid philosophical or ethical discussions with beings they deemed inferior, although they enjoyed arguing in favor of law.[9] Due to their vast superiority with respect to the average humanoid, they often had difficulty in understanding the everyday troubles and needs of communities and in some rare instances might even end up becoming tyrants.[10]The gold dragon Aurinax guarding the Vault of Dragons in Waterdeep.Gold dragons preferred to parlay before a fight, using their intimidating presence and insight to determine if fighting was necessary, to find advantages, and to buy time to cast preparatory spells.[4][9] If fighting became necessary, they made heavy use of fire-based spells such as delayed blast fireball and fire shield, as well as deterrent spells such as cloudkill, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow, and stinking cloud.[4]A common tactic for gold dragons in a fight was to use their breath weapons as means to scatter and weaken their foes.[3] They possessed two such breath weapons: a powerful fire breath and a cone of weakening gas.[1][4]Every gold dragon in the world acknowledged a hierarchy which spanned the entire race. This structure had a single elected leader at the top: a wyrm or great wyrm called the King (or Queen) of Justice who bore the honorific \"Your Resplendence\" and served until death or resignation. The selection of a replacement (either by election or, more frequently, by acclamation) was a process in which all gold dragons took part. It was also possible for two dragons of equal merit to be elected as leaders, in which case they could share duties or alternate leadership.[9][11]Because gold dragons were well aware of their responsibilities, the duties of the King of Justice were typically light. They would most frequently act as advisors to other dragons and their quests to defeat evil, pointing out consequences and hidden ramifications. Less frequently, the gold dragon ruler acted as a representative of the entire race when dealing with other species, or as a judge in the extremely rare occasion in which a gold dragon committed an offense.[9][11]Gold dragons did not have strong preferences about their lairs, but they tended to choose lairs made of stone, such as caves and castles, and recruited other loyal creatures as guards.[3][4]An angry gold dragon defending its treasure.The lair of a gold dragon possessed some residual magic. While in its lair, a gold dragon had a limited capability to glimpse into the future and to banish invaders into a dream plane of the dragon's own creation. The region around the lair also experienced some magical effects, such as banks of opalescent mists that haunted evil creatures and warned good creatures of danger. The dragon also was capable of establishing a telepathic contact with sleeping creatures within 6\u202fmiles (9.7\u202fkilometers) of its lair. Within 1\u202fmile (1.6\u202fkilometers) of the lair, gems and pearls shone and emitted a faint light.[1]Gold dragons enjoyed treasure that showed artisanship, such as paintings, sculptures, calligraphy and porcelain.[9] They had a great fascination for magic items and loved to add them to their hoards.[11] It was common for them to magically ward their hoards so that it was impossible for an item to be removed without the dragon's knowledge.[1]Gold dragons were known to reside in the Serpent Hills, the Earthfast Mountains, the Vast, the Graypeak Mountains, Loudwater, the Orsraun Mountains and Turmish.[12]When choosing a mate, gold dragons could spend years debating philosophy and ethics and questing together as part of their courtship. Prospective mates then sought approval from the King of Justice. Some gold dragons mated for life through a rite known as the Oath of Concord, while others only mated for a short time. They could be monogamous or hold several mates at the same time.[9][11]Gold dragons raised their young with exceptional care. A gold dragon wyrmling did not have whiskers, but they developed quickly. It was also common for gold dragon parents to send their young to the care of foster parents. This could serve a variety of reasons, such as freeing the parents for a quest, or just broadening their horizons.[9]Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young adult gold dragons tended to be solitary or lived in a clutch of 2 to 5 dragons; adults, mature adults, older dragons, wyrms or great wyrms would live solitarily, in a pair, or a family consisting of a couple of adults and several offspring.[4]Gold dragons were the only species of dragon to have their own written language. However, they could only write in human form, since their dragon claws were not practical for holding writing equipment.[13]These dragons even kept records of historic events. The content of these records was mostly useless to human historians however, as they described dragon events like dragon births, trials and deaths, rather than events that affected the non-dragon world.[11]Protanther leading the council of metallic dragons in the Nether Mountains.During the glory days of Myth Drannor, before its destruction in the Weeping War, gold dragons were one of the races that dwelled in the City of Song in harmony. At one point before the city's fall, the gold dragons of Myth Drannor aided in magically trapping a powerful demon Rivener who became too powerful to defeat after he stole one of the Baneblades of Demron.[14]Sometime before 1357 DR, Protanther was King of Justice for western Faer\u00fbn until he resigned in favor of Lareth,[11] who kept the title until his death in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.[15] He was succeeded by Tamarand, who still held the title as of 1479 DR.[16]Sometime in the late 1480s DR Protanther represented the gold dragons by gathering a council of metallic dragons in the battle against the reformed Cult of the Dragon's efforts to summon Tiamat.[17]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "Green dragons were most notable for the large, waving crest or fin that started at the dragon's nose and ran the entire length of the dragon's body. They also had exceptionally long, slender forked tongues.[citation needed]A review of green dragon anatomy.These dragons were known to have very bad tempers and a tendency for evil behavior.[6] They loved intrigue and secrets. They put up a front of diplomacy and deceit when dealing with stronger foes, but they revealed their cruel and petty nature when intimidating lesser beings or when gaining the upper hand. They delighted in stalking their enemies and listening in for any information they could gather before moving to attack. Green dragons especially enjoyed corrupting or consuming elves and fey creatures.[citation needed]Beyond fighting with their massive jaws and claws, these dragons were capable of expelling a cone of poisonous chlorine gas.[6]Green dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and their appearance was considered a good omen by his followers.[7]Green dragons valued their territory, but only as a means to gain as much power as possible without expending considerable effort. They would sometimes trade safe passage for a worthy item to add to their hoards. Even so, they were extremely cunning and duplicitous foes, and loved double-crossing others. A traveler who stumbled into a green dragon's territory might be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but more often than not the dragon would pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard was down. Worse, if the traveler impressed the green dragon during its stay, they might start thinking of the newcomer as a prized possession to be corrupted and sculpted to its will.[citation needed]The typical green dragon lair was located underground[6] and was a complex of caves and tunnels, with its main entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The preferred green dragon lair was a cave high up on a cliff, but such locations were usually hard to find and thus only home to the oldest and most powerful green dragons.[citation needed]These dragons were typically found to live near woodlands.[6]A green dragon wyrmling.Green dragons were reasonably good parents, with both mother and father typically staying close to their eggs while they were incubating. Green dragon females either kept their eggs in a solution of acid or buried them in leaves moistened with rainwater. The green wyrmling was easily mistaken for a black, due to their nearly black scales. As the wyrmling matured, its scales became steadily lighter in color until they reached the striking green shade of an adult. The wyrmlings typically stayed with both parents until they reached adulthood (approximately 100 years).[citation needed]One of the ways of creating a wand of stinking cloud was using a horn of an old green dragon.[8]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons were also the most fearsome and cruel. These dragons delighted in ruin, death and destruction.[8] They breathed a cone of fire.[4]Red dragons were physically distinguished by their enormous size and wingspan. They had two large horns upon their heads, which pointed backwards toward their wings. They smelled of smoke and sulfur.[10]Like all chromatic dragons, reds lived their lives in cycles of activity and hibernation. While these cyclical rhythms weren't as extreme as green dragons, red dragons sealed themselves within their lairs for upwards of ten years at a time.[11] During their active periods they were known as voracious over-hunters, whose hunger ensured that the populations of any nearby creatures did not grow beyond ecological stability.[12]A red dragon with a humanoid in its graspRed Dragons believed that they were the pinnacle of draconic nature and that all other species were impure. They valued vengefulness, rapaciousness, avarice, and ferocity above other traits and recognized these traits in themselves with pride. They were solitary creatures and cared little for news of other types of dragons. However, they did look for news of other red dragons in their area.[8]If they believed their own achievements and possessions to be greater than these other red dragons then they stayed in their caves, smugly congratulating themselves. However, if they learned that the achievements or possessions of the other red dragons were greater than their own they would fly into a vengeful rage, decimating the surrounding area until they believed that they had outdone their rivals. The dragon became much less cautious during this time and much more likely to underestimate their foes.[8]A red dragon would go to extreme lengths to ensure that they were superior to every other red dragon in the area. They would often burn down only half a village or let a single adventurer flee from a battle so that word of their power spread throughout the region. Not only would this anger other red dragons but it was also like a shining beacon to adventurers and treasure hunters.[8][10]Red dragons despised weakness among their own kind. If one ever found out that another of their kin demonstrated any signs of fragility, either by getting badly wounded or if they were becoming senile in old age, then local red dragons would descend on the lair, stripping it clean and usually killing the owner. They believed that if a red dragon could not protect what it had, then it did not deserve it to begin with.[13]Reds were also highly territorial. Entering an area a red considered its domain was just asking to be attacked, especially if it was another dragon entering the area (even more so if it was a red dragon). Conflict was inevitable if this were the case and it was almost always to the death as neither would dare show weakness to the other. Thankfully, most other species were smart enough to flee if they realized the area belonged to a red dragon. Red dragons could get so territorial that in rare occasions they would adopt a protective yet patronizing attitude towards creatures they considered inferior that lived within their self-imposed borders.[8]Red dragons hated any authority other than their own. They never asked elders for advice, even if doing so would save their lives as to them, admitting they needed something their elders had was the same as putting themselves under their authority.[citation needed]A red dragon incinerating a pesky adventurer.Red dragons expelled an extremely devastating cone of fire.[1] Adventurers which were either banded together too tightly or lacked fire protection would likely find themselves burned to a crisp before they could even begin to battle the mighty enemy. Red dragons prefer to fight with their physical bite and claws, but they might barbecue obviously powerful or numerous foes before bloodletting with glee. The dragons would also prefer not to use their breath on particularly weak enemies so as to not destroy the valuable treasure they carry.A review of red dragon anatomy.Red dragons made their homes in mountainous lairs particularly throughout the peaks of northwestern and northern Faer\u00fbn, surrounding the great desert of Anauroch.[14] They were particularly abundant around the snow-capped mountains of the Spine of the World.[15]Some red dragons have been spotted as far south as the Sunset Mountains, or even Tethyr,[16] though they generally avoided any rangers near \"civilized\" lands.[14]Red dragons loved to make their lairs in deep, underground caves in mountainous regions. Many preferred to dwell in volcanoes, where the intense heat kept others at bay. Almost all red dragons simply required a high perch. The higher the better as they believed that their domain encompassed all that they could see.[10]Young red dragons, especially wyrmlings were easy prey for predators and hunters due to their bright, glossy scarlet scales, so they tended to stay underground in the darkness until they felt that they could defend themselves properly.[10]Many red dragons were known to worship the deities Bane, Garyx, Loviatar, and Malar.[17]Mating was initiated by the female every century or so when she felt the urge to have children. She looked for the nearest red dragon with the most wealth and power. As such, males never denied their advances. It was a sign of prestige among other males to be requested to mate.[13]After mating, the male then abandoned her while she hatched her eggs. She jealously guarded the clutch, occasionally with the assistance of an infertile female, but rarely laid down her own life for her hatchlings.[13] An average red dragon clutch had four eggs and had an incubation time of 270 days.[10]A red dragon notices the last survivor of a burning town.Once her young reached the young adult stage of development, or sometimes earlier, the mother's natural instincts overruled her maternal ones and she forced all of her young from her territory.[13]Red dragons hated silver dragons with a passion as their familiarity with the element of cold and other natural powers often made red dragons appear weak in battle with them. They also commonly came into conflict with copper dragons for territory rights, though copper dragons rarely won out against the more powerful red dragons in open conflict.[8]Above all though, red dragons hated gold dragons. Red dragons might loudly proclaim that they would fight and defeat any gold dragon they came across but often found an excuse not to fight when that time eventually came. Gold dragons were so similar to red dragons yet their natural moral differences were extreme.[8]A small contingent of red dragons served high-ranking githyanki as mounts and companions, following a treaty established with Tiamat during the war between the gith and the mind flayers. The dragons served the githyanki during their young age, being dismissed as soon as they reached adulthood and keeping the wealth accumulated over their years of service.[18]The dragons resented their time of servitude, but were eager to participate in raids thanks to the promise of treasure and of growing in power. The dragons remained loyal to their riders as long as they were treated respectfully and were given ample opportunities to pillage.[18]It was said the flesh of red dragons tasted extremely spicy. To be properly prepared, it had to be exposed to open air for at least two days and aged for some time. Anyone who ate red dragon meat that was not treated in this manner was susceptible to horrible cramps and extreme pain.[19] In addition, the bones and scales of all dragons can be used to craft powerful magical equipment with the correct know-how (for example, dragon scale mail). The equipment would usually be imbued with the elemental powers of the dragon it came from, so in the case of red dragons, such equipment would either protect from or deal fire damage.\"Visiting\" a red dragon's lair could be a reckless endeavor.Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "A silver dragon enjoyed the company of humans and elves so much that it would often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life. However, it should be noted that silvers, like all dragons, believed themselves the most superior creatures in the world. However, apart from the ability to fly, which they enjoyed greatly, they tended to prefer the physical forms of humanoids for everyday life.[9]An overview of silver dragon anatomy.The silver dragon was regal and statuesque.[4]At first glance, a silver dragon appeared very similar to a white dragon. The wings were more curved than a white's, however, and a silver had two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also had a beautiful frill that began at the top of its head and flowed all the way down its neck and body to the tip of its tail. The frill was silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They had two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also had a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which had the rough appearance of a goatee. They smelled like rain.[9]They were very intelligent, more so than most humans, extremely powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and had lifespans that could reach 4,200 years.[7]Unlike the gold and bronze dragons, the silver dragon did not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. Instead, it waited for others to ask them for help; They would attempt to right an injustice if they saw one, but they had no inclination to intentionally seek evil out and destroy it. Silver dragons were more interested in protecting the humans or elves that came to its care.[9]One unusual trait they had was the love of human dining;[4][9] moreover, they would use their alternate form ability to take part in large feasts.Like most metallic dragons, silvers did not enjoy combat, and were averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they were as deadly as any other dragon.[9]Silver dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a cone of freezing cold, similar to that of white dragons. The second was a cone of paralyzing gas.[4]Silver dragons were extremely rare and elusive, preferring to take the guise of kind and elderly humanoids or very attractive and young humanoids. They very much liked to associate with elves and humans, not necessarily because they preferred their company over other races, but because they tried to learn from the shorter-lived humans.[9]Most silvers grouped together in \"clans\", a loose organization of dragons who chose to live together as a family. Clans took communal responsibility for protecting and raising their wyrmlings. A senior member of the clan might act as a leader, but no true leader actually existed. Silver dragons did not feel the need for a strict social structure, since they were most content to live as honestly as possible.[9]Silver dragons' favored enemy were red dragons because these chromatic dragons were almost always evil and had a talent for destruction. Additionally, silvers and reds favored the same sort of terrain for lairs, which led to territorial disputes on top of having attitudes and philosophies at odds with the others.[9]Dragons could live for millennia, while humans only lived a few decades. This vast difference in time led to inherent psychological differences concerning time. Dragons tended to think things through for years at a time, using their razor-sharp intellects to hone a plan to perfection, solve incalculable puzzles, or other such things. Silver dragons, however, noted that humans were able to accomplish much in their short lifespans because of their ambitious drive for success. When a silver dragon could combine its own long-term perspective with a quick and ambitious attitude, the benefit was undeniable.[9]Some silver dragons served certain deities as servants, including Aerdrie Faenya, Arvoreen, Corellon, Eilistraee, Gaerdal Ironhand, Gorm Gulthyn, Labelas Enoreth, Moradin, Sehanine Moonbow, Torm, and Yondalla.[10]A silver dragon's lair was typically found within an icy mountain, with the main entrance only accessible by air. The lair itself was similar to the gold dragon's in its sophistication and design, although the silver dragon's lair tended to be far less intricate. A typical lair would contain a main entertaining area, a storage room, a vault, a sleeping chamber, study, library, shrine, and two clinic rooms where the dragon could offer help and protection to those who needed it. The lair would also have a concealed back entrance for use in emergencies.[citation needed]Silver dragons laid their eggs in a bed of snow.[citation needed] A newly hatched silver wyrmling had scales of a bluish gray, which changed to silver over time.[5] Silver wyrmlings were intelligent, kind, extremely curious, and adorable.[citation needed]As they matured, many silver dragons left their clans for long periods of time to live among nondragons. They tended to live for many years with the same group of humans or elves, having grown attached to them. As members of the family died, the silver dragon, grieved by the loss, often chose to stay with the family, remaining a true and loyal friend and champion through many generations. If the dragon felt comfortable enough around these nondragons, it might even decide to reveal its true self.[citation needed]Not actually a silver dragon in any case.During the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, a brainwashed Luna used shapechange to turn into a silver dragon and attacked her friends Vajra Valmeyjar, Kyriani Agrivar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright outside the House of the Moon.

        "description": "A review of white dragon anatomy.White dragons were physically the smallest of the chromatic dragons, even smaller than black dragons. They appeared in shades from white to grey and ice-blue, and in arctic environments, this appearance served as good camouflage.[8]White dragons were physically distinguished by several features: their heads and necks seemed to blend seamlessly into one another, and their wings appeared somewhat frayed along the edges. They had a flap of skin, called a dewlap, lined with spines beneath their chins. Their heads were very streamlined, and they had high crests atop their skulls. They had a crisp, vaguely chemical odor.[citation needed]White dragon toes were spaced more widely than those of other dragons, with barbed claws to aid movement on ice. Their very thin eyelids prevented snowblindness when observing arctic landscapes.[8]When in the stage of being a wyrmling, white dragons had a less pronounced crest and small stubs where their future horns would be. They completely lacked the dewlap and their bodies were protected by a leathery white hide in place of scales.[9]White dragons were not strong combatants as dragons went, but they were not to be underestimated. Their icy breath could freeze an unprepared foe solid in an instant. They typically avoided fights with more powerful dragons, but would avail themselves of any opportunity to take their frustrations out on \"lesser\" creatures.[citation needed]Whites also had exceptional memories,[8] and would often hunt down beings who crossed them, no matter how long it might take.[citation needed] They were not as cruel as black dragons and were not as ferocious as reds, but they were still competent in combat.[8]White dragons preferred to attack first, then eat their prey, rather than pausing to ask questions. They did not often contemplate what to eat, simply choosing the most convenient prey, and would often freeze it after the kill by burying it in snow or ice for days.[8]White dragons expelled a cone of intense cold, a direct hit from which was fatal as it instantly froze its victim. Even a glancing blow could be seriously debilitating.[citation needed]A white dragon nest.They were still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and had exceptional long-term memories. Adult white dragons had several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat: they could climb ice cliffs with ease, fly very high and fast, and were exceptional swimmers. They loved to swim in cold water; the more frigid, the better. Much of their diet consisted of aquatic creatures, even whales.[8] White dragons were always hungry, and tended to become more savage as they matured. Knowing that they were the smallest and weakest of dragons, many whites harbored inferiority complexes. They took any opportunity to bully beings such as giants and younger dragons of other species.[citation needed] White dragons preferred to scavenge for and collect treasure, rather than involving themselves in politics as other dragons might. Like other dragons, they looked down on others, and tended to view other creatures as prey.[8]Most white dragons laired in ice caves, often dug into the side of an arctic mountain, on tundra, or glacial plains, although they did not need ice and snow, and some settled near mountain peaks or in forests. They could create their own caves by applying the breath weapon to tightly packed snow in order to transform it into solid ice.[8]White dragons made their homes in frozen lands and ice-covered mountains. Their lairs often contained many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. More powerful white dragons would sometimes turn a large iceberg into a floating lair. Such lairs always had an underwater entrance as well as one to the open air.[citation needed]Whites preferred glittery treasure that resembled ice, such as diamonds or light gems, but platinum, silver, and anything reflective or polished works of art were also popular.[8]Back when her domains included winter, some white dragons were known to worship the Raven Queen.[10]The wyrmling Calcryx in her underground lair near Thundertree.White dragons usually laid about eight or ten eggs in a clutch. A white dragon egg was incubated for fourteen months. The first three and a half months were within the mother's body. On average, between a quarter and a third survived to hatching.[8]White dragon eggs had to be buried in snow or encased in ice while incubating. The parents did not bother to tend or protect the eggs in any way, although they would usually lay them near their lairs. A newly hatched white wyrmling had scales as clear as ice, which became white as the dragon matured. They were expected to survive on their own from the moment they hatched, although some white dragon parents would permit their young to live in their lair until they reached adulthood.[citation needed]The wyrmling developed into a young dragon after about three or four years, and then into an adult after about 100 years. Elder white dragons aged from about 750 years, while ancients aged from 1700 years, and the oldest white dragons lived around 2100 years.[8]A depiction of a white dragon from Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

Some were reported to be as small as 8\u201216\u202fft (2.4\u20124.9\u202fm) tall,[7] while others were reported being as tall as 40\u201280\u202fft (12\u201224\u202fm) tall.[6][3]Though they all roughly shared the same abilities, those in the Elemental Plane of Air that were incapable of being summoned were known to possess even greater powers.[7]Air elementals typically fought creatures by either blasting them with strong gusts of wind or shifting into their whirlwind form.[6]Air elementals substituted on the consumption of solely air itself.[6]Air elementals were native to the Elemental Plane of Air.[7]Aerial servants often tried to accompany them wherever they went, but air elementals strove to avoid them. They viewed the aerials as an inferior form of air elemental and discouraged other kinds of air elementals from interacting with them.[10]A berserk air elemental dwelled on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain.[11]",

Physically, they were most distinguished by their horns, which protruded from the sides of their heads and wrapped around, projecting forward. A large frill adorned the upper part of the neck. They smelled like rotting vegetation and foul water. A black dragon grew up to a maximum size of 16\u202ffeet (4.9\u202fmeters) tall, 85\u202ffeet (26\u202fmeters) in length, with a wingspan of 80\u202ffeet (24\u202fmeters). They weighed up to 160,000\u202fpounds (73,000\u202fkilograms).[11]Solitary and extremely territorial in their nature, black dragons would seldom form clans, opting to do so only when they lived in the most hazardous of environments or when faced with a danger that could wipe out large swaths of their population.[9]Black dragons preferred ambushes to straightforward fighting.[8]A review of black dragon anatomy.Black dragons breathed a stream of acid.[5][4]Black dragons lived in swamps, jungles and fetid marshlands.[10] They were cunning creatures who lived to inspire fear and rule by intimidation. The black, glossy scales of black dragons added to their camouflage within swamp lands. They preferred to ambush their targets, using darkness or water as their cover. They were excellent swimmers and often made their lairs in submerged caves or underground chambers near swamps or murky ponds. Their lairs always had two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp or pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth.[12]Female dragons took the lead when it came to breeding, choosing their mate largely based on the size of the hoard of prospective males. Because of this, male black dragons would often brag about their accumulated wealth to communicative creatures or others of their own kind, in the hopes that rumors of their hoard would spread to any females in the area that were looking to mate. When two or more females selected the same male as their partner, they would fight for dominance high in the air above the lair of the male, allowing him to gaze upon his future mate's victory in admiration.[9]Black dragons were not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them personally. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while growing, which helped protect the dragon as well.[13] Black dragons would only protect their young so long as that responsibility didn't threaten their own life. If they had to choose between saving their own life or those of their clutch or spawn, they would most certainly choose the former; though they would assuredly seek revenge afterwards.[9]Black dragon wyrmling.A black dragon's diet consisted of fish, mollusks, aquatic critters and some red meat from terrestrial animals.[12]The skies over the southwestern Bay of Chessenta and southern Chondalwood have been the source of multiple sightings of black dragons. Reports from the jungles of Chult of dense, multi-layered tropical forest complete with its own ecosystem, were highlighted with tales of black dragons living within the canopy.[10]The iconography of the Purple Dragon Knights of Cormyr stemmed from the legend of the great black dragon Thauglor, who once dominated the area upon which the kingdom was built.[14]Black dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and were seen as good omens by his followers.[15]A black dragon demonstrating its acid breath.Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

When they were so burrowed, their large horns could easily be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.Blue dragons used a shocking burst of lightning.Blue dragons were native to arid wastelands and deserts. They made their lairs in underground caves; easily accessible to the dragons, as they could burrow through the ground. These dragons would fly above their territory, using the bleak landscape and its sparse terrain features as their best chance of spotting opponents. The typical blue dragon lair was dug into one of the towering rock formations that dominate desert landscapes. As with all dragon lairs, the blue dragon's lair would have two entrances: one at ground level and hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it could perch and survey its territory. Each lair also had a large subterranean cavern with a large pool of water and a sandy beach, which its inhabitant would use for drinking and relaxation.Despite their evil nature, blue dragons were actually excellent parents to their young, and would rarely leave their eggs unattended. Blue dragon eggs must be buried in warm sand to incubate. Blue wyrmlings were actually quite cute, but they were quick to taunt any other creature, and even quicker to hunt small desert creatures for food.Blue dragon WyrmlingChromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "A review of brass dragon anatomy.Physically, the brass dragon was highly distinctive. From below, its outstretched wings formed a triangular shape, as they were attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings were longest at the shoulder, and tapered gently as they reached the tail. Their scales seemed to radiate heat and light. As their name implied, brass dragons tended to have brass-colored scales. Their scales were a dull brown at a young age, becoming more glossy and brass-like in appearance as they aged. The shape of the head was quite unusual, as it included a large, curved plate that extended from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and curved upwards into two points. They had two sharp horns on the chin, which became steadily pointier as the dragon aged. They smelled like metal.[6]Brass dragons very rarely engaged in combat, preferring to talk rather than fight. If they considered a creature threatening, they would subdue it with their sleeping gas. In the face of true danger, a younger brass dragon would have most likely flown away and hidden in the sand. It would have fought and used its fire breath only as an absolute last resort. Older brass dragons preferred to avoid combat but would fight if they had the tactical advantage[7]Brass dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a narrow line of fire, and the second was a cone of sleep gas.[5]Brass dragons hunted their prey while flying, mainly consuming antelope, mountain goats and sheep. Only evil brass dragons hunted intelligent creatures. Brass dragons have evolved for living in the desert and therefore can go long periods without water.[8]A stuffed young brass dragon was kept in the Obstacle Course level of Undermountain.[9]Brass dragons were native to arid regions; they shared many similar habitats with blue dragons, which often led to conflict. The brass dragon preferred to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also preferred to have the bulk of their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun would warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon's lair was well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders.[6] The centerpiece of any brass dragon's lair was the Grand Conversation Hall, where it spent the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. A typical lair also contained an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon collected, a sleeping chamber, and a storage room. All brass dragon lairs had several small entrances, known as bolt holes. These multiple entrances allowed a brass dragon to easily escape an attack by a blue dragon or other predator.[citation needed]Brass dragon eggs were incubated in a nest of open flames. Incubation took approximately 480 days.[10] The eggs were typically tended by both parents, so that they could talk together as they maintained their vigil. The newly hatched brass wyrmling was not remarkable in appearance; its scales were a dull brown. The scales became lighter and more brilliant as the dragon matured. Brass wyrmlings probably learned to talk more quickly than the young of any other sapient species. They talked constantly about anything and everything, and they would talk to anybody: friends, family, enemies and small creatures that could not talk back, or even to itself if nobody else was near. When exposed to a new language, a brass wyrmling would usually become fluent in under an hour.[citation needed]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "A review of bronze dragon anatomy.Physically, the bronze dragon was quite fierce in appearance, despite its good nature. While most of its body was a reflective bronze color, the wings were often tipped with green. The dragon had four large horns on each side of their heads, three protruding from each cheek and one from the top of their head, pointing back towards the tail. The tips of these points were black and very sharp, and were often used for grooming. The tongue was purple-gray, long and pointed, and not forked. A large frill ran down the upper part of its neck.[citation needed]Bronze dragons smelled like sea spray.[6]These dragons possessed the ability to alter their form, assuming the appearance of any type of animal or humanoid creature they choose. As such, many could have encountered a bronze dragon without ever being the wiser. A friendly dolphin that saved a drowning child; a mercenary sailor eager to fight pirates; a diver specializing in searching undersea shipwrecks for possible treasure\u2026 all of these could have been a bronze dragon. Many bronze dragons would use their shape-shifting abilities to get close to an enemy target; bronze dragons prefer melee combat.[citation needed]Bronze dragons could speak with animals, create food and water, make fog, control water and weather, and detect thought.[citation needed]While bronze dragons were often fascinated with battles, especially fighting to defeat evil, they had strong moral compunctions against killing living beings unless absolutely necessary. They would often join good-aligned armies to fight the forces of evil, either in human form or their own. In battle, their weapon of choice was to breathe repulsion gas, which is so putrid that it forced absolutely everything away. They also liked to relocate a foe to a remote location where it could do no harm when possible. When absolutely forced to kill, the bronze dragon was a deadly combatant, roasting enemies with bursts of lightning or ripping them open with its clawed forelegs.[citation needed]Bronze dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of electricity similar to a lightning bolt, and the second was either a cone of gas that affected the minds of creatures caught in it, causing them to flee for a short time,[7] or a cone of repulsion energy which physically pushed enemies away.[1]They truly enjoyed observing and interacting with smaller creatures, most especially humans. They often went out of their way to help them, such as rescuing humans from a shipwreck or a dangerous foe. In many of these instances, the bronze dragon would transform itself into a human, so that those who it helped never knew who really did the rescuing. They would never seek payment for their help, in any form. They always sought justice as best they could, and could not abide to see any creature being treated with cruelty of any sort. The older the dragon, the more pronounced the passion for justice became. They were probably the most social species of dragon, and often swam and played together in groups. They also loved to attend human festivals and parties, although usually in human form. The bronze dragons were spiritually connected to silver dragons as they have similar personalities and were each involved in an ancient ritual.[citation needed]Bronze dragons were often found along the coastal regions of the world. They liked to dwell along the sea, to make use of their aquatic abilities, while staying close to humanoid settlements. Many ship merchants would pay a bronze dragon to protect their trade routes. More nefarious bronze dragons would demand bribes for \u201cprotection\u201d while accepting similar bribes from pirates to operate within their territories. Given its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair was quite naturally underwater, and was often disguised with seaweed and coral. The bulk of the lair was above water level, however, consisting of multiple tunnels and large chambers, some as much as a thousand feet above sea level. They preferred to make their lairs in an island volcano, if possible.[citation needed]A bronze dragon wyrmlingBronze dragons mated for life, and took their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness. They protected their eggs and their wyrmlings at any cost. Although bronze dragons always lived near water, they laid their eggs in a dry cave. Apart from a dry, relatively warm environment, bronze dragon eggs required no special conditions for incubation like those of most dragons. Upon hatching, the wyrmlings were raised, taught, and protected by their parents. A newly-hatched bronze wyrmling appeared yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales gradually shifted to bronze as it matured. Bronze wyrmlings loved to swim in the ocean, and frolic in much the same manner as dolphins.[citation needed]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "Copper dragons had short faces, with features that included cheek ridges that pointed backwards, as well as frills on the back of their lower jaws. Their long segmented horns started as smooth brow plates above their eyes that extended backwards. From their chins, layers of triangular blades grew downward, growing more numerous as they aged. Combined together, those features gave copper dragons a pensive look. As they aged, their pupils faded away until their eyes acquired an appearance of glowing turquoise.[1][7]Their wings were manta-like, mottled with red and green discolorations near the end. They were supported at the front by relatively short articulated alar limbs that gave them a characteristic U shape when viewed from below, as well as spines that ran the wings' length to the back, at an angle from the backbone.[7]Newly hatched copper dragons had brown scales with a metallic tint, which grew coppery and glossy in color as the dragon aged. The scales of very old copper dragons acquired a green shade.[1][7]Copper dragons gave off a stony scent.[7]When it came to open battle, copper dragons were formidable fighters.[8]Copper dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of powerful acid, and the second was a cone of gas that slowed anyone within it.[3]A review of copper dragon anatomy.Copper dragons were usually even-tempered and sociable. They were well known for playing pranks and telling jokes and riddles. They enjoyed a good joke, riddle, funny story, or any form of good humor or wit, but became annoyed if someone didn't laugh at a joke that they made or take their pranks well. These habits made them especially fond of bards, and they appreciated their company enough that they were sometimes willing to set aside a temporary separate space for them in their lairs so they might provide entertainment.[1]However, they could also be greedy, envious, and stingy, and particularly dangerous when their treasure hoards were at threat. Nevertheless, good companionship was just as much a treasure to them.[1]A copper dragon's lair was usually found in rocky, dry uplands and hilltops, created inside narrow caverns within them. False walls could be created by the dragon in the lair to hide secret chambers and their most treasured items. Other things that were worthless to the copper dragon were placed away from the main hoard in order to tease treasure-seekers. In their main hoard, copper dragons kept precious ores, artworks, and curios that they had accumulated over their long lifetimes.[1]Copper dragons were often found in the service of the deities Brandobaris, Erevan Ilesere, and Vergadain.[9]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "This is a\nGood Article!A review of gold dragon anatomy.A gold dragon's head was characterized by a short face with long and smooth metallic horns that swept back from its nose and brow, as well as the neck frills that adorned both sides of its neck. From the mouth and nostrils descended four pairs of long, flexible muscular spines that resembled whiskers or barbels. Along with the dragon's narrow eyes, these features contributed to give them a look of sagacity. As the dragon aged, its pupils faded away until the eyes acquired an appearance of shiny, liquid gold. Other facial features included a pointed tongue and small cheek horns that grew sideways.[1][9][10]Gold dragons had broad sail-like wings[note 1] that started from their shoulders and extended all the way to the end of their extremely long tails. During flight, the wings moved in a graceful rippling motion that resembled swimming. This elegant flying motion was considered by many scholars, as well as by the gold dragons themselves, to be the most graceful among true dragons. When on the ground, the wings were kept closed upright over its back if the dragon was at rest, or folded facing back if the dragon was walking or running.[1][9]A newly hatched gold dragon had dark yellow scales dotted with metallic specks that increased in size with age, until they totally covered the scales, giving a shiny and radiant golden color to the adult dragon's entire body.[1][9][10]Despite being capable of eating almost anything, gold dragons tended to hunt large and dangerous monsters[10] and were particularly fond of including pearls and gems in their diet. Older dragons even had the ability to supernaturally locate gems in their vicinity. They tended to receive such gifts well, except if they were given as bribes.[1][4]Gold dragons could breathe underwater.[1][4] They gave off scents of saffron and incense,[9] and sometimes a faint smell of molten metal.[10]A gold dragon teaching a human.It was common for gold dragons to appoint themselves with quests to promote good. Those that earned a gold dragon's fury found a relentless enemy who would not rest until the utter and complete subjugation of the evildoers. Either by slaying or by bringing villains to justice, a gold dragon's only acceptable outcome was complete victory over evil.[9]When looking for a lair, gold dragons usually sought secluded and remote locations. They had a preference for idyllic or picturesque locations, such as rivers or the bottom of lakes, cave complexes, ancient ruins, deep gorges, high plateaus, or mist-covered islands.[1][9] They also had a preference for rolling hills, open plains, and in some rare cases even within humanoid communities which they have chosen to protect.[10] They were very private creatures, mostly keeping to themselves and their families and rarely fraternizing with other dragons.[1]Older gold dragons were capable of shapeshifting into humanoid or beast forms. They usually spent most of the time in this form, even within their lairs. When traveling, it was common for a gold dragon to assume a particularly non-threatening form in order to put adventurers at ease, as well as to observe local communities and to catch up on gossip and news of the outside world. In many cases, the dragon would use its disguise to provide help, company and comfort to those in need, or to set up traps for evildoers by using itself as bait.[1][9]Strong believers in the greater good and in the rule of order, gold dragons were sometimes viewed as arrogant and dismissive. They tended to avoid philosophical or ethical discussions with beings they deemed inferior, although they enjoyed arguing in favor of law.[9] Due to their vast superiority with respect to the average humanoid, they often had difficulty in understanding the everyday troubles and needs of communities and in some rare instances might even end up becoming tyrants.[10]The gold dragon Aurinax guarding the Vault of Dragons in Waterdeep.Gold dragons preferred to parlay before a fight, using their intimidating presence and insight to determine if fighting was necessary, to find advantages, and to buy time to cast preparatory spells.[4][9] If fighting became necessary, they made heavy use of fire-based spells such as delayed blast fireball and fire shield, as well as deterrent spells such as cloudkill, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow, and stinking cloud.[4]A common tactic for gold dragons in a fight was to use their breath weapons as means to scatter and weaken their foes.[3] They possessed two such breath weapons: a powerful fire breath and a cone of weakening gas.[1][4]Every gold dragon in the world acknowledged a hierarchy which spanned the entire race. This structure had a single elected leader at the top: a wyrm or great wyrm called the King (or Queen) of Justice who bore the honorific \"Your Resplendence\" and served until death or resignation. The selection of a replacement (either by election or, more frequently, by acclamation) was a process in which all gold dragons took part. It was also possible for two dragons of equal merit to be elected as leaders, in which case they could share duties or alternate leadership.[9][11]Because gold dragons were well aware of their responsibilities, the duties of the King of Justice were typically light. They would most frequently act as advisors to other dragons and their quests to defeat evil, pointing out consequences and hidden ramifications. Less frequently, the gold dragon ruler acted as a representative of the entire race when dealing with other species, or as a judge in the extremely rare occasion in which a gold dragon committed an offense.[9][11]Gold dragons did not have strong preferences about their lairs, but they tended to choose lairs made of stone, such as caves and castles, and recruited other loyal creatures as guards.[3][4]An angry gold dragon defending its treasure.The lair of a gold dragon possessed some residual magic. While in its lair, a gold dragon had a limited capability to glimpse into the future and to banish invaders into a dream plane of the dragon's own creation. The region around the lair also experienced some magical effects, such as banks of opalescent mists that haunted evil creatures and warned good creatures of danger. The dragon also was capable of establishing a telepathic contact with sleeping creatures within 6\u202fmiles (9.7\u202fkilometers) of its lair. Within 1\u202fmile (1.6\u202fkilometers) of the lair, gems and pearls shone and emitted a faint light.[1]Gold dragons enjoyed treasure that showed artisanship, such as paintings, sculptures, calligraphy and porcelain.[9] They had a great fascination for magic items and loved to add them to their hoards.[11] It was common for them to magically ward their hoards so that it was impossible for an item to be removed without the dragon's knowledge.[1]Gold dragons were known to reside in the Serpent Hills, the Earthfast Mountains, the Vast, the Graypeak Mountains, Loudwater, the Orsraun Mountains and Turmish.[12]When choosing a mate, gold dragons could spend years debating philosophy and ethics and questing together as part of their courtship. Prospective mates then sought approval from the King of Justice. Some gold dragons mated for life through a rite known as the Oath of Concord, while others only mated for a short time. They could be monogamous or hold several mates at the same time.[9][11]Gold dragons raised their young with exceptional care. A gold dragon wyrmling did not have whiskers, but they developed quickly. It was also common for gold dragon parents to send their young to the care of foster parents. This could serve a variety of reasons, such as freeing the parents for a quest, or just broadening their horizons.[9]Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young adult gold dragons tended to be solitary or lived in a clutch of 2 to 5 dragons; adults, mature adults, older dragons, wyrms or great wyrms would live solitarily, in a pair, or a family consisting of a couple of adults and several offspring.[4]Gold dragons were the only species of dragon to have their own written language. However, they could only write in human form, since their dragon claws were not practical for holding writing equipment.[13]These dragons even kept records of historic events. The content of these records was mostly useless to human historians however, as they described dragon events like dragon births, trials and deaths, rather than events that affected the non-dragon world.[11]Protanther leading the council of metallic dragons in the Nether Mountains.During the glory days of Myth Drannor, before its destruction in the Weeping War, gold dragons were one of the races that dwelled in the City of Song in harmony. At one point before the city's fall, the gold dragons of Myth Drannor aided in magically trapping a powerful demon Rivener who became too powerful to defeat after he stole one of the Baneblades of Demron.[14]Sometime before 1357 DR, Protanther was King of Justice for western Faer\u00fbn until he resigned in favor of Lareth,[11] who kept the title until his death in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.[15] He was succeeded by Tamarand, who still held the title as of 1479 DR.[16]Sometime in the late 1480s DR Protanther represented the gold dragons by gathering a council of metallic dragons in the battle against the reformed Cult of the Dragon's efforts to summon Tiamat.[17]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "Green dragons were most notable for the large, waving crest or fin that started at the dragon's nose and ran the entire length of the dragon's body. They also had exceptionally long, slender forked tongues.[citation needed]A review of green dragon anatomy.These dragons were known to have very bad tempers and a tendency for evil behavior.[6] They loved intrigue and secrets. They put up a front of diplomacy and deceit when dealing with stronger foes, but they revealed their cruel and petty nature when intimidating lesser beings or when gaining the upper hand. They delighted in stalking their enemies and listening in for any information they could gather before moving to attack. Green dragons especially enjoyed corrupting or consuming elves and fey creatures.[citation needed]Beyond fighting with their massive jaws and claws, these dragons were capable of expelling a cone of poisonous chlorine gas.[6]Green dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and their appearance was considered a good omen by his followers.[7]Green dragons valued their territory, but only as a means to gain as much power as possible without expending considerable effort. They would sometimes trade safe passage for a worthy item to add to their hoards. Even so, they were extremely cunning and duplicitous foes, and loved double-crossing others. A traveler who stumbled into a green dragon's territory might be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but more often than not the dragon would pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard was down. Worse, if the traveler impressed the green dragon during its stay, they might start thinking of the newcomer as a prized possession to be corrupted and sculpted to its will.[citation needed]The typical green dragon lair was located underground[6] and was a complex of caves and tunnels, with its main entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The preferred green dragon lair was a cave high up on a cliff, but such locations were usually hard to find and thus only home to the oldest and most powerful green dragons.[citation needed]These dragons were typically found to live near woodlands.[6]A green dragon wyrmling.Green dragons were reasonably good parents, with both mother and father typically staying close to their eggs while they were incubating. Green dragon females either kept their eggs in a solution of acid or buried them in leaves moistened with rainwater. The green wyrmling was easily mistaken for a black, due to their nearly black scales. As the wyrmling matured, its scales became steadily lighter in color until they reached the striking green shade of an adult. The wyrmlings typically stayed with both parents until they reached adulthood (approximately 100 years).[citation needed]One of the ways of creating a wand of stinking cloud was using a horn of an old green dragon.[8]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons were also the most fearsome and cruel. These dragons delighted in ruin, death and destruction.[8] They breathed a cone of fire.[4]Red dragons were physically distinguished by their enormous size and wingspan. They had two large horns upon their heads, which pointed backwards toward their wings. They smelled of smoke and sulfur.[10]Like all chromatic dragons, reds lived their lives in cycles of activity and hibernation. While these cyclical rhythms weren't as extreme as green dragons, red dragons sealed themselves within their lairs for upwards of ten years at a time.[11] During their active periods they were known as voracious over-hunters, whose hunger ensured that the populations of any nearby creatures did not grow beyond ecological stability.[12]A red dragon with a humanoid in its graspRed Dragons believed that they were the pinnacle of draconic nature and that all other species were impure. They valued vengefulness, rapaciousness, avarice, and ferocity above other traits and recognized these traits in themselves with pride. They were solitary creatures and cared little for news of other types of dragons. However, they did look for news of other red dragons in their area.[8]If they believed their own achievements and possessions to be greater than these other red dragons then they stayed in their caves, smugly congratulating themselves. However, if they learned that the achievements or possessions of the other red dragons were greater than their own they would fly into a vengeful rage, decimating the surrounding area until they believed that they had outdone their rivals. The dragon became much less cautious during this time and much more likely to underestimate their foes.[8]A red dragon would go to extreme lengths to ensure that they were superior to every other red dragon in the area. They would often burn down only half a village or let a single adventurer flee from a battle so that word of their power spread throughout the region. Not only would this anger other red dragons but it was also like a shining beacon to adventurers and treasure hunters.[8][10]Red dragons despised weakness among their own kind. If one ever found out that another of their kin demonstrated any signs of fragility, either by getting badly wounded or if they were becoming senile in old age, then local red dragons would descend on the lair, stripping it clean and usually killing the owner. They believed that if a red dragon could not protect what it had, then it did not deserve it to begin with.[13]Reds were also highly territorial. Entering an area a red considered its domain was just asking to be attacked, especially if it was another dragon entering the area (even more so if it was a red dragon). Conflict was inevitable if this were the case and it was almost always to the death as neither would dare show weakness to the other. Thankfully, most other species were smart enough to flee if they realized the area belonged to a red dragon. Red dragons could get so territorial that in rare occasions they would adopt a protective yet patronizing attitude towards creatures they considered inferior that lived within their self-imposed borders.[8]Red dragons hated any authority other than their own. They never asked elders for advice, even if doing so would save their lives as to them, admitting they needed something their elders had was the same as putting themselves under their authority.[citation needed]A red dragon incinerating a pesky adventurer.Red dragons expelled an extremely devastating cone of fire.[1] Adventurers which were either banded together too tightly or lacked fire protection would likely find themselves burned to a crisp before they could even begin to battle the mighty enemy. Red dragons prefer to fight with their physical bite and claws, but they might barbecue obviously powerful or numerous foes before bloodletting with glee. The dragons would also prefer not to use their breath on particularly weak enemies so as to not destroy the valuable treasure they carry.A review of red dragon anatomy.Red dragons made their homes in mountainous lairs particularly throughout the peaks of northwestern and northern Faer\u00fbn, surrounding the great desert of Anauroch.[14] They were particularly abundant around the snow-capped mountains of the Spine of the World.[15]Some red dragons have been spotted as far south as the Sunset Mountains, or even Tethyr,[16] though they generally avoided any rangers near \"civilized\" lands.[14]Red dragons loved to make their lairs in deep, underground caves in mountainous regions. Many preferred to dwell in volcanoes, where the intense heat kept others at bay. Almost all red dragons simply required a high perch. The higher the better as they believed that their domain encompassed all that they could see.[10]Young red dragons, especially wyrmlings were easy prey for predators and hunters due to their bright, glossy scarlet scales, so they tended to stay underground in the darkness until they felt that they could defend themselves properly.[10]Many red dragons were known to worship the deities Bane, Garyx, Loviatar, and Malar.[17]Mating was initiated by the female every century or so when she felt the urge to have children. She looked for the nearest red dragon with the most wealth and power. As such, males never denied their advances. It was a sign of prestige among other males to be requested to mate.[13]After mating, the male then abandoned her while she hatched her eggs. She jealously guarded the clutch, occasionally with the assistance of an infertile female, but rarely laid down her own life for her hatchlings.[13] An average red dragon clutch had four eggs and had an incubation time of 270 days.[10]A red dragon notices the last survivor of a burning town.Once her young reached the young adult stage of development, or sometimes earlier, the mother's natural instincts overruled her maternal ones and she forced all of her young from her territory.[13]Red dragons hated silver dragons with a passion as their familiarity with the element of cold and other natural powers often made red dragons appear weak in battle with them. They also commonly came into conflict with copper dragons for territory rights, though copper dragons rarely won out against the more powerful red dragons in open conflict.[8]Above all though, red dragons hated gold dragons. Red dragons might loudly proclaim that they would fight and defeat any gold dragon they came across but often found an excuse not to fight when that time eventually came. Gold dragons were so similar to red dragons yet their natural moral differences were extreme.[8]A small contingent of red dragons served high-ranking githyanki as mounts and companions, following a treaty established with Tiamat during the war between the gith and the mind flayers. The dragons served the githyanki during their young age, being dismissed as soon as they reached adulthood and keeping the wealth accumulated over their years of service.[18]The dragons resented their time of servitude, but were eager to participate in raids thanks to the promise of treasure and of growing in power. The dragons remained loyal to their riders as long as they were treated respectfully and were given ample opportunities to pillage.[18]It was said the flesh of red dragons tasted extremely spicy. To be properly prepared, it had to be exposed to open air for at least two days and aged for some time. Anyone who ate red dragon meat that was not treated in this manner was susceptible to horrible cramps and extreme pain.[19] In addition, the bones and scales of all dragons can be used to craft powerful magical equipment with the correct know-how (for example, dragon scale mail).

        "description": "A silver dragon enjoyed the company of humans and elves so much that it would often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life. However, it should be noted that silvers, like all dragons, believed themselves the most superior creatures in the world. However, apart from the ability to fly, which they enjoyed greatly, they tended to prefer the physical forms of humanoids for everyday life.[9]An overview of silver dragon anatomy.The silver dragon was regal and statuesque.[4]At first glance, a silver dragon appeared very similar to a white dragon. The wings were more curved than a white's, however, and a silver had two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also had a beautiful frill that began at the top of its head and flowed all the way down its neck and body to the tip of its tail. The frill was silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They had two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also had a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which had the rough appearance of a goatee. They smelled like rain.[9]They were very intelligent, more so than most humans, extremely powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and had lifespans that could reach 4,200 years.[7]Unlike the gold and bronze dragons, the silver dragon did not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. Instead, it waited for others to ask them for help; They would attempt to right an injustice if they saw one, but they had no inclination to intentionally seek evil out and destroy it. Silver dragons were more interested in protecting the humans or elves that came to its care.[9]One unusual trait they had was the love of human dining;[4][9] moreover, they would use their alternate form ability to take part in large feasts.Like most metallic dragons, silvers did not enjoy combat, and were averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they were as deadly as any other dragon.[9]Silver dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a cone of freezing cold, similar to that of white dragons. The second was a cone of paralyzing gas.[4]Silver dragons were extremely rare and elusive, preferring to take the guise of kind and elderly humanoids or very attractive and young humanoids. They very much liked to associate with elves and humans, not necessarily because they preferred their company over other races, but because they tried to learn from the shorter-lived humans.[9]Most silvers grouped together in \"clans\", a loose organization of dragons who chose to live together as a family. Clans took communal responsibility for protecting and raising their wyrmlings. A senior member of the clan might act as a leader, but no true leader actually existed. Silver dragons did not feel the need for a strict social structure, since they were most content to live as honestly as possible.[9]Silver dragons' favored enemy were red dragons because these chromatic dragons were almost always evil and had a talent for destruction. Additionally, silvers and reds favored the same sort of terrain for lairs, which led to territorial disputes on top of having attitudes and philosophies at odds with the others.[9]Dragons could live for millennia, while humans only lived a few decades. This vast difference in time led to inherent psychological differences concerning time. Dragons tended to think things through for years at a time, using their razor-sharp intellects to hone a plan to perfection, solve incalculable puzzles, or other such things. Silver dragons, however, noted that humans were able to accomplish much in their short lifespans because of their ambitious drive for success. When a silver dragon could combine its own long-term perspective with a quick and ambitious attitude, the benefit was undeniable.[9]Some silver dragons served certain deities as servants, including Aerdrie Faenya, Arvoreen, Corellon, Eilistraee, Gaerdal Ironhand, Gorm Gulthyn, Labelas Enoreth, Moradin, Sehanine Moonbow, Torm, and Yondalla.[10]A silver dragon's lair was typically found within an icy mountain, with the main entrance only accessible by air. The lair itself was similar to the gold dragon's in its sophistication and design, although the silver dragon's lair tended to be far less intricate. A typical lair would contain a main entertaining area, a storage room, a vault, a sleeping chamber, study, library, shrine, and two clinic rooms where the dragon could offer help and protection to those who needed it. The lair would also have a concealed back entrance for use in emergencies.[citation needed]Silver dragons laid their eggs in a bed of snow.[citation needed] A newly hatched silver wyrmling had scales of a bluish gray, which changed to silver over time.[5] Silver wyrmlings were intelligent, kind, extremely curious, and adorable.[citation needed]As they matured, many silver dragons left their clans for long periods of time to live among nondragons. They tended to live for many years with the same group of humans or elves, having grown attached to them. As members of the family died, the silver dragon, grieved by the loss, often chose to stay with the family, remaining a true and loyal friend and champion through many generations. If the dragon felt comfortable enough around these nondragons, it might even decide to reveal its true self.[citation needed]Not actually a silver dragon in any case.During the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, a brainwashed Luna used shapechange to turn into a silver dragon and attacked her friends Vajra Valmeyjar, Kyriani Agrivar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright outside the House of the Moon. However, the spell did not last long, and she quickly reverted to human form.[11][note 2]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "A review of white dragon anatomy.White dragons were physically the smallest of the chromatic dragons, even smaller than black dragons. They appeared in shades from white to grey and ice-blue, and in arctic environments, this appearance served as good camouflage.[8]White dragons were physically distinguished by several features: their heads and necks seemed to blend seamlessly into one another, and their wings appeared somewhat frayed along the edges. They had a flap of skin, called a dewlap, lined with spines beneath their chins. Their heads were very streamlined, and they had high crests atop their skulls. They had a crisp, vaguely chemical odor.[citation needed]White dragon toes were spaced more widely than those of other dragons, with barbed claws to aid movement on ice. Their very thin eyelids prevented snowblindness when observing arctic landscapes.[8]When in the stage of being a wyrmling, white dragons had a less pronounced crest and small stubs where their future horns would be. They completely lacked the dewlap and their bodies were protected by a leathery white hide in place of scales.[9]White dragons were not strong combatants as dragons went, but they were not to be underestimated. Their icy breath could freeze an unprepared foe solid in an instant. They typically avoided fights with more powerful dragons, but would avail themselves of any opportunity to take their frustrations out on \"lesser\" creatures.[citation needed]Whites also had exceptional memories,[8] and would often hunt down beings who crossed them, no matter how long it might take.[citation needed] They were not as cruel as black dragons and were not as ferocious as reds, but they were still competent in combat.[8]White dragons preferred to attack first, then eat their prey, rather than pausing to ask questions. They did not often contemplate what to eat, simply choosing the most convenient prey, and would often freeze it after the kill by burying it in snow or ice for days.[8]White dragons expelled a cone of intense cold, a direct hit from which was fatal as it instantly froze its victim. Even a glancing blow could be seriously debilitating.[citation needed]A white dragon nest.They were still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and had exceptional long-term memories. Adult white dragons had several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat: they could climb ice cliffs with ease, fly very high and fast, and were exceptional swimmers. They loved to swim in cold water; the more frigid, the better. Much of their diet consisted of aquatic creatures, even whales.[8] White dragons were always hungry, and tended to become more savage as they matured. Knowing that they were the smallest and weakest of dragons, many whites harbored inferiority complexes. They took any opportunity to bully beings such as giants and younger dragons of other species.[citation needed] White dragons preferred to scavenge for and collect treasure, rather than involving themselves in politics as other dragons might. Like other dragons, they looked down on others, and tended to view other creatures as prey.[8]Most white dragons laired in ice caves, often dug into the side of an arctic mountain, on tundra, or glacial plains, although they did not need ice and snow, and some settled near mountain peaks or in forests. They could create their own caves by applying the breath weapon to tightly packed snow in order to transform it into solid ice.[8]White dragons made their homes in frozen lands and ice-covered mountains. Their lairs often contained many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. More powerful white dragons would sometimes turn a large iceberg into a floating lair. Such lairs always had an underwater entrance as well as one to the open air.[citation needed]Whites preferred glittery treasure that resembled ice, such as diamonds or light gems, but platinum, silver, and anything reflective or polished works of art were also popular.[8]Back when her domains included winter, some white dragons were known to worship the Raven Queen.[10]The wyrmling Calcryx in her underground lair near Thundertree.White dragons usually laid about eight or ten eggs in a clutch. A white dragon egg was incubated for fourteen months. The first three and a half months were within the mother's body. On average, between a quarter and a third survived to hatching.[8]White dragon eggs had to be buried in snow or encased in ice while incubating. The parents did not bother to tend or protect the eggs in any way, although they would usually lay them near their lairs. A newly hatched white wyrmling had scales as clear as ice, which became white as the dragon matured. They were expected to survive on their own from the moment they hatched, although some white dragon parents would permit their young to live in their lair until they reached adulthood.[citation needed]The wyrmling developed into a young dragon after about three or four years, and then into an adult after about 100 years. Elder white dragons aged from about 750 years, while ancients aged from 1700 years, and the oldest white dragons lived around 2100 years.[8]A depiction of a white dragon from Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "Ankhegs were covered in a strong chitin armor.[1]Ankhegs could see in pitch darkness, as well as detect vibrations in the earth, from up to 60\u202ffeet (18\u202fmeters) away.[1] The \"attack\" acid was part of the digestive system for the creature, so it couldn't digest food for six hours after a discharge.[4]An ankheg bursting out of the ground to attack.The ankheg was an ambush predator that waited around 5\u201310 feet underground[6][4] for prey to wander into position. The attack was quick, as the prey was crushed and ground in its mandibles and assaulted with acidic digestive enzymes. If a foe proved too difficult, the ankheg could also squirt acid to take it down.[1] If several ankhegs were attacking a group, the ankhegs would try to attack different targets. If prey was attacked by more then one ankheg, the ankhegs would just play tug-of-war with the unfortunate prey.[6]A typical area could have a lone ankheg, a pair,[2] or a cluster of ankhegs.[6]Ankhegs that lived in colder areas hibernated during winter. During this time, an ankheg took nutrients through its shell and its antenna.[citation needed]Gaining nutrients from the ground, the ankheg also had to hunt fresh meat to sustain itself.[1] It could also eat decaying meat.[4]The four stages of the Ankheg life cycle.Ankhegs mated in autumn, when the fertilized female would kill the male to lay 6\u201312 eggs inside him. Usually, a high number of eggs survived and hatched within two to ten days and started to feed.[2]An ankheg broodling did not hunt and remained hidden, while its mother brought it sustenance.[2] After a year, the young were able to fend for themselves.[4]Around the second year, the young ankheg shed its chitin before winter. It took a little less than ten days to complete the process and grow a new shell. During this time, the youngling was slower and more vulnerable. To defend itself, it secreted a fluid that smelled like rotten fruit. This defense could backfire, as some would seek out the smell.[4]Living in warm climates, the ankheg dwelt in partially collapsed burrows usually around 40 feet underground.[6][4] The ankheg hunted in forests or grasslands where prey would wander into its traps.[1][4] If an area became too barren, the ankheg moved on to other, more lucrative areas.[4] Ankheg tunnels were sometimes filled with the remains of victims, eggs, or chitin.[1] Their tunnels would sometimes be around 60 to 150\u202ffeet (18 to 46\u202fmeters) long and 5\u202ffeet (1.5\u202fmeters) feet high.[6][4] Hollow tunnel ends were used for lair purposes, such as sleeping or hibernation.[4]They were known to compete with giant ants for territory. If they were killed or driven away from their nest, the broodlings left behind would be made to serve the giant ant colony.[2]Ankhegs could prove to be useful for a farmer. Provided it stayed alive, its tunnels could bring in water and its excrement contained enriching minerals.[1] Ankheg burrows also aerated the nearby land which could improve crop yields by as much as 15%, providing the ankheg population was managed.[11]An ankheg shell harvested from a slain ankheg weighed roughly 100\u202fpounds (45\u202fkilograms) Armorers like Taerom Fuiruim in Beregost could forge armor from the shells. It took three days to make. The armor was very nearly as effective as full plate mail, but weighed considerably less and could be worn by warriors who usually couldn't wear such heavy armor. Taerom claimed to sell ankheg armor to rich nobles for 20,000 gold pieces. However, if one provided the shell, he would charge just 4000 gold pieces for a set of completed armor.[11]A stuffed ankheg was kept in the Obstacle Course layer of Undermountain.[12]",

        "description": "Many cities across Faer\u00fbn had a single archmage who dedicated themselves to serve that settlement and its people. Some notable cities included Lyrabar in Impiltur,[2] and the great western metropolis of Waterdeep.[3]The term \"archmage\" was often used to refer to spellcasters who took on leadership roles among similarly-inclined practitioners of The Art. In the drow city of Menzoberranzan, the head of the arcane academy known as Sorcere was granted the title, Archmage of Menzoberranzan.[4] Similarly, the leader of the Arcane Brotherhood was referred to as the Archmage Arcane.[5]Archmages continued developing their skills as spellcasters in the same manner as they had during their previous experiences in the Art. While they gained knowledge and lore about \"high arcana\" (that typical wizards and sorcerers had no knowledge of), they were forced to focus less on the number of spells they could prepare each day.[1]By forgoing one of their most powerful spells, archmages could tap into a power known as arcane fire. This arcane fire was essentially a bolt of raw magical energy that was drawn from the power they typically reserved for normal spellcasting.[1]They learned techniques that allowed them to reach across long distances, using spells that normally took effect upon touch and utilizing them from as far away as 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm).[1][6]As archmages were considered master spellcasters, it followed that they were capable of mastering particular elements of spellcasting. Rather than performing typical counterspelling, archmages could turn spells back upon their casters. They mastered ways to alter their spells that drew upon the elements, particularly those that were acidic, cold, fiery, electric, or sonic in nature. Additionally, they perfected the practice of \"spell shaping\", and could readily manipulate the area over which a spell took effect.[6]Plainly put, the spells cast by archmages were capable of a level of power unheard of by typical spellcasters. Overall, they functioned more intensely than lesser experienced wizards and sorcerers. By forgoing one of the spells they would normally prepare, they could cast a spell twice in a day or more, without having to normally inscribing it within their spellbook.[6]Many sun elves who wished to continue their arcane studies often chose the path of the archmage,[7] as did many of the human Red Wizards.[8]",

        "description": "Azers bore a resemblance to dwarves, but with brass-colored skin and hair, their hair and beards composed of flames. Azer bodies were so hot that their weapons conducted heat, so much so that any creature within reach of an azer was injured by the intense heat.[7] Many azers wore kilts and apron-like garments made from beaten brass, bronze, or copper.[3][4][5]Azer often wielded broad-bladed javelins and mallet-like weaponry in combat.[4]Azer society was best described as communal, as every individual had a place in society and matters of the state were more important than that of the individual. Living within fortresses made of bronze on the Elemental Plane of Fire, azer nobles wielded absolute power.[3] Their outposts and cities were typically complexes of tower built from basalt, granite, or metal. Within these cities they grew strange trees with metallic bark and leaves.[4]Despite loving gems and constantly waging war against the efreet, Azers never started a fight unless the foe was carrying gems and in which case they might take them prisoner.[3]Azer beard hair was used to weave a powerful Kossuthan magic cloak\u2013 the Mantle of Hell's Furnace.[8]Azers were often slaves of fire giants and titans.[7] As for the other races, azers despised efreet, with whom they were often at war.[3] They maintained good relations with the yak folk found on the planes.[9]Azer often acted as servants of the deities Dumathoin, Gorm Gulthyn, Kossuth, Laduguer, and Moradin.[10]Some sages claimed that dwarves were once all enslaved to giants and titans; modern dwarves descended from those who escaped slavery, while azers were the descendants of those who'd remained enslaved and were unable to escape their captors. Exposure to the Plane of Fire produced their unique fire qualities.[2]Others maintained that azers were in fact native to the Elemental Plane of Fire and that their dwarvish appearance was merely a fa\u00e7ade.[1]The azers had once been allies of the efreet, and even helped build the City of Brass. When construction was finished, the efreet betrayed the azers, trying to enslave them to prevent their knowledge of the city's secrets from spreading. Since then, the fact that the azers knew secret ways into the city had prevented the efreet from unleashing an all-out conflict, so that only skirmishes between them happened.[1]At some point, the archmage Trobriand summoned five azers to work for him on his layer of Trobriand's Graveyard in Undermountain. Later, the gnome Zox Clammersham was able to trick them into serving him, claiming to be Trobriand's apprentice.[11]",

        "description": "Balors were imposing humanoid figures that stood about 12\u202ffeet (3.7\u202fmeters) tall and weighed 4,500\u202fpounds (2,000\u202fkilograms). A powerful aura of darkness enveloped their grotesque forms, as their deep red skin was wrapped in glaring flames.[3] A pair of massive bat-like wings allowed them to soar throughout the air with unnatural agility. Although they were naturally armed with venom-dripping fangs and fearsome claws, they were also normally armed with a sword of lightning and a multi-tailed whip of flame.[4]Rising above the cold, emotionless logic of the mariliths was the passionate rage of the balors.[8] Driven by an overwhelming and primal urge to do battle, balors constantly strove to increase their own power and prestige, all while sowing chaos, terror, and misery for others.[3] They were creatures caught within their own spells of overpowering fervor, from the highest points of conceit to the lowest levels of self-hatred, constantly pushing themselves to unleash their emotions and obtain a release they would never find.[9]Despite their raw fury, they were still highly intelligent beings capable of concocting vile schemes.[8] Their wicked charisma allowed them to sway legions of demons underneath their banners, enjoying battle as much as they delighted in the subtle corruption and destruction of the innocent.[3][5]A balor faces off against a pit fiend.Balors were beings of flame and cinders, constantly exuding fire too hot for most to bear, being immune to fire themselves, and exploding into a lurid flash of light that destroyed everything nearby upon death. Their flaming whips had tails ending in hooks, spikes, and balls, allowing them to easily draw in those netted by them. Balors were able to summon hordes of dretches, other weak demons, or smaller numbers of more powerful tanar'ri.[3][2]Despite their overwhelming power, many balors favored scheming and plotting rather than doing battle on the front lines. They preferred to battle from afar using their spells, abilities, and ranged weapons, utilizing their incredible flying speed and teleportation skills to navigate the battlefield with ease.[3][10]When fighting head on, balors focused incessantly on one opponent on a time.[2] Those that bothered to learn wizardry could become powerful archmages capable of bringing great devastation with their magic.[11]An engraving of a balor.While many believed that there were only twenty-four balors within the Abyss, this was merely the number that were known at one point.[7][8] Rather than stay within specific areas, most balors roamed the Abyss gathering soldiers to create their armies, giving them commands in their battles against the baatezu.[4] Typically a tanar'ri horde was lead by a marilith, with balors commanding multiple hordes in larger battles.[12]Balors were the very heart of the Blood War, their wrathful devotion an awesome inspiration that roused furious bloodlust in their inferiors, a display that the logical moves of the mariliths couldn't hope to match.[9] Because they were among the most important demons in regards to the Blood War, the balors could be said to be part of the Abyss's immune system against Hell,[4] ironically causing them to lean towards organized evil.[5]Their relationship with other demons was complicated due to the position and views of the balors. Glabrezus were favored by balors due to their corrupting influence and use of temptation against mortals. Mariliths and nalfeshnees viewed the balors as unnecessary figures only in command due to their power, and that their greater intelligence and tactical skills were superior. Nalfeshnees in particular would take every opportunity to undermine the Blood War and embarrass their balor masters rather than directly challenge their authority.[13] In general, balors were dreaded beings who preferred to be around creatures just short of their own power rather than weaklings or equals. While two balors might occasionally team up, any alliance would normally break after some time had passed due to their natural competitiveness.[2]On the other hand, beings more powerful than the balor did exist, such as the molydei and klurichirs. The former, despite reporting to the balors, worked for their respective demon lords above all else and would not hesitate to report a rebellious balor.[14] Klurichirs were significantly stronger than balors and might casually beat them if they stepped out of line or committed a perceived act of laziness. [15] Demon lords in particular did not favor balors as servants due to their malevolent force of personality and ability to unite demons to their will, hence the molydei to help keep them in line.[4][5]Balors were among the few demons that recognized a crucial underlying principle of the Blood War, that being the other planes. All planes were possible battlegrounds, and the Prime Material Plane in particular was crucial. Balors nearly always benefited from pacts made on the Material Plane by exchanging demonic help for influence on the plane, as with every ally and follower they made, the more magical power flowed back to them for use in the Blood War.[4] As such, balors were some of the most likely demons to work with mortal individuals or groups, if properly invoked and made the right offers and promises. However, any team with a balor among its ranks would be beset by the balor's attempts to either assume a leadership role or usurp it from the current leader.[5] Some balors still lurked within the depths of the natural world, whether in preparation for conquest and bloodshed, or unwillingly bound there.[2]Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

It was unclear whether they were related to the old pirate Bartholomew Blackdagger or were simply inspired to adopt his name and legacy. They gathered a small gang and turned to banditry, and had much success. Coming to be called the Blackdagger Bandits, they became notorious and yet more bandits and other criminals went to their side.[1]\nWith the rebuilding of Neverwinter in the 1470s DR, trade along the Sword Coast North swelled and so too did the Blackdagger Bandits' numbers and riches. They seized and rebuilt the ruins of Cragmire Keep, making it their fortress and base of operations. They engaged in banditry, piracy, shipwrecking, slaving and extortion of local businesses such as Melkhor Goldseeker's Angelhead Mine. With the Blackdaggers posing a serious threat and disrupting trade, Lord Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter put a bounty on the heads of Malus and Traven Blackdagger. Shortly after, the two brothers apparently disappeared and were not seen by anyone outside the bandit army. This started much speculation and rumors that someone else now commanded the Blackdagger Bandits, who remained as powerful and organized as before.[1]\n\u201c\nAll you need to do is keep the Blackdaggers going like nothing is wrong, Jareth, so no one gets suspicious. I'll be back, and I'll have an army when I do.\n\nDon't let me down.\n\u201d\n\u2014 Traven's note to Jareth, 1479 DR[1]\nThe truth was more nefarious. The Red Wizard necromancer Kallos Tam met Malus and Traven and proposed to excavate and take control of the undead army within the Cragmire Crypts, giving them the army they desired to take over Neverwinter and become lords of the land. The brothers were receptive to his offer, and, in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, he broke the magical seal of Cragmire Crypt and discovered inside some artifacts he was seeking, found the undead army still waiting there, and, he said, the means of controlling them. While Malus prepared the defenses of Blackdagger Keep and an attack of Neverwinter itself, Traven and Kallos went with some of the Blackdaggers' best fighters into the crypts to take the undead army, and they put Jareth Grim in charge of the Blackdaggers' raids.[1]\nDownfall\nThat year, Melkhor's miners uncovered ancient ruins and statues in Angelhead Mine. Whereas previously the Blackdaggers had cared little for mining and the mines had no other value to them, they now believed they could find treasure too, broke their deal with Melkhor, and refused to make another. The Blackdaggers raided Melkhor's wagons and Krag Foultooth and his bandits assaulted Angelhead, imprisoned and enslaved the miners, and took Melkhor's niece and mine foreman Mira Thamros hostage to ensure his silence and cooperation. Marion Hexbane, meanwhile, sent some of her men to the Broken Crown inn to apply their new leverage on Melkhor.[1]\nOther victims of the Blackdaggers at the time were Old Len, the lighthouse keeper, whom the bandits robbed; halfling settlers migrating to Neverwinter, who lost their supplies to the bandits; and a group of ghostwise halflings led by Gilern Ghostwise. Cecil Proudfoot recruited a halfling adventurer to aid the latter two. The High Road was left littered with slain bodies and wrecked and looted wagons.[1]\n\u201c\nThe end of the Blackdagger Bandits starts today.\n\u201d\n\u2014 Xalliana's declaration[1]\nHowever, the Blackdaggers' enemies were not idle. The Neverwinter Guard sent Spycatcher Westband to apprehend Blackdagger spies and retrieve any information they carried; operating out of the Broken Crown inn, he recruited adventurers for this task. The Harpers had their gnoll agent Garl Gnarlclaw work undercover with the Blackdaggers for months, learning much about their operations. They offered their aid to Neverwinter, and Sergeant Alphonse Knox sent the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to meet the Harper agent Seven Toes at the Broken Crown. Seven Toes in turn had the adventurer find fellow Harper Xalliana, herself a survivor of one of the shipwrecks. Working together, Xalliana and the adventurer disrupted the shipwrecking and salvaging operations at Raven Cliff Beach, defeated Marion Hexbane, and discovered the Blackdaggers' extortion of Melkhor Goldseeker. Finding Melkhor, he admitted what had happened at Angelhead. The adventurer discovered survivors led by Sergeant \"Dusty\" Yates and liberated the mine from Krag Foultooth.[1]\nMeanwhile, a drow spy of House Xorlarrin worked with the Blackdaggers to provide them with magical weapons and aid. An unnamed drow operative of Bregan D'aerthe learned of this and had a drow adventurer sabotage the delivery at Raven Cliff Beach to make it seem as if the Xorlarrin had double-crossed the Blackdaggers. When the Xorlarrin spy came out of hiding to meet with the Blackdaggers to repair relations, just as the operative planned, he sent the adventurer to slay the spy and her contacts in the abandoned mineshaft they met in.[1]\nIn time, Xalliana discovered Kallos Tam's plot and sent the adventurer to work with Garl Gnarlclaw. With targeted attacks, they thinned their ranks and weakened their command structure. Garl then helped the adventurer infiltrate Grimstorm Keep and slay the bandits' raid leader, Jareth Grim, to sabotage their leadership. Later, he sent a band of adventurers into Cragmire Crypts to seek Xalliana, and found and defeated Traven Blackdagger and Kallos Tam. Finally, Garl and Xalliana were able to move a siege tower close to Blackdagger Keep. With it, they sent a band of adventurers to storm the keep and finally slay Malus Blackdagger before his bandit army could assault Neverwinter. Thanks to these efforts, the Blackdaggers were broken and scattered.[1]\nActivities\nBlackdaggers at the beach.\nBy 1479 DR, the Blackdagger Bandits were engaged in a wide range of criminal activities. They robbed travellers and raided caravans on the High Road north of Neverwinter. They extinguished warning beacons at Raven Cliff Beach, causing ships to be caught and wrecked on the treacherous rocks, so they could loot the wrecks and enslave the survivors, and salvaged the debris that washed up onshore. Blackdagger pirates were reported to be plying the waters off the Sword Coast. They even engaged in protection rackets with businesses like Melkhor Goldseeker's Angelhead Mine, demanding from Melkhor a large cut of the profits to leave the mines alone.[1]\nMembers\nThe Blackdagger Bandits were commended by the brothers Traven Blackdagger and Malus Blackdagger. They were advised by Kallos Tam, a Red Wizard. Their lieutenants were Jareth Grim, the battle-leader in charge of raids during their absence; Marion Hexbane, who oversaw the shipwrecking and salvaging operations at Raven Cliff Beach; and Krag Foultooth, leader of a group of gnolls who allied with the Blackdaggers. Beneath them were officers, enforcers, and \"hexer\" mages. The rank-and-file were many human and elf bandits, who operated as cutthroats, snipers, and salvagers, while the different gnolls were termed \"huntsmen\", \"fangs\", \"bloodtrackers\", and \"deathpledged\".[1]\nBase of Operations\nThe headquarters of the Blackdagger Bandits was the ruined Cragmire Keep, which they partially rebuilt and renamed Blackdagger Keep. A central was named Grimstorm Keep after Jareth Grim when he was raid leader. From here, they launched their raids and looting efforts along the High Road, and when threatened by patrols they could retreat to the safety of its walls.[1]\nThey also prowled Raven Cliff Beach, where they picked over and looted shipwrecks, and based themselves in a hidden cove and sea caves there. They set up tents and cranes for the work and collected whole crates and chests.[1]\nAppendix\nBackground\nEarly versions of Neverwinter gave the Blackdagger Bandits a very different backstory via one of its in-game Lore entries. In this, Traven and Malus were pirate captains who operated on the Sword Coast North between Neverwinter and Luskan some time after the Spellplague of 1385 DR and reigning from Blackdagger Keep, until they were killed and the keep destroyed in the Mount Hotenow eruption. The ruins were later occupied by bandits and Kallos Tam reanimated and controlled the Blackdagger brothers, who took over the bandits and turned them undead. The Harpers became involved because of rumors of a Red Wizard among them. However, this Lore entry was later removed and the undead models for Traven and Malus replaced with living models. Some elements of this remained, with undead-seeming models for Marion Hexbane and others and pirate trappings for bandits who seem to do little actual piracy. In any case, the whole Blackdagger Ruins zone and this storyline were removed in July 2021.\nEither way, the connection of the Blackdagger Bandits to the still-undead actual pirates led by Bartholomew Blackdagger in the Pirates' Skyhold zone is unknown. However, a Lore entry there makes allusions to new Blackdagger pirates and the question of whether they are related to or simply inspired by Bartholomew Blackdagger. In addition, both Blackdaggers use the same banner and crest, displayed above, but this may be a case of a reused model.\nGallery\nA sneaky elf spy.\nGnoll huntsman and elf sniper.\nA human enforcer and an elf sniper.\nA deathpledged gnoll serving as lookout from atop a looted wagon.\nA hexer mage taking a rest on one of Melkhor's log books.\nAppearances\nNeverwinter\nExternal Links\nBlackdagger Bandits article at the Neverwinter Wiki, a wiki for the Dungeons and Dragons: Neverwinter MMORPG.\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 1.12 1.13 1.14 1.15 1.16 Cryptic Studios (June 2013).

With targeted attacks, they thinned their ranks and weakened their command structure. Garl then helped the adventurer infiltrate Grimstorm Keep and slay the bandits' raid leader, Jareth Grim, to sabotage their leadership. Later, he sent a band of adventurers into Cragmire Crypts to seek Xalliana, and found and defeated Traven Blackdagger and Kallos Tam. Finally, Garl and Xalliana were able to move a siege tower close to Blackdagger Keep. With it, they sent a band of adventurers to storm the keep and finally slay Malus Blackdagger before his bandit army could assault Neverwinter. Thanks to these efforts, the Blackdaggers were broken and scattered.[1]\nActivities\nBlackdaggers at the beach.\nBy 1479 DR, the Blackdagger Bandits were engaged in a wide range of criminal activities.

The Harpers became involved because of rumors of a Red Wizard among them. However, this Lore entry was later removed and the undead models for Traven and Malus replaced with living models.

Neverwinter. Perfect World Entertainment. Survey: How do you feel about gaming microtransactions?   The Blackdagger Bandits were a powerful bandit group that operated on the Sword Coast North in the late 15th century DR and were the most successful and notorious bandits of the area at the time. It was named for and led by the brothers Malus and Traven Blackdagger.[1] Hailing from Luskan some time in the 1400s DR, Malus and Traven Blackdagger started out as a pair of penniless brothers. It was unclear whether they were related to the old pirate Bartholomew Blackdagger or were simply inspired to adopt his name and legacy. They gathered a small gang and turned to banditry, and had much success. Coming to be called the Blackdagger Bandits, they became notorious and yet more bandits and other criminals went to their side.[1] With the rebuilding of Neverwinter in the 1470s DR, trade along the Sword Coast North swelled and so too did the Blackdagger Bandits' numbers and riches. They seized and rebuilt the ruins of Cragmire Keep, making it their fortress and base of operations. They engaged in banditry, piracy, shipwrecking, slaving and extortion of local businesses such as Melkhor Goldseeker's Angelhead Mine. With the Blackdaggers posing a serious threat and disrupting trade, Lord Dagult Neverember of Neverwinter put a bounty on the heads of Malus and Traven Blackdagger. Shortly after, the two brothers apparently disappeared and were not seen by anyone outside the bandit army. This started much speculation and rumors that someone else now commanded the Blackdagger Bandits, who remained as powerful and organized as before.[1] The truth was more nefarious. The Red Wizard necromancer Kallos Tam met Malus and Traven and proposed to excavate and take control of the undead army within the Cragmire Crypts, giving them the army they desired to take over Neverwinter and become lords of the land. The brothers were receptive to his offer, and, in the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, he broke the magical seal of Cragmire Crypt and discovered inside some artifacts he was seeking, found the undead army still waiting there, and, he said, the means of controlling them. While Malus prepared the defenses of Blackdagger Keep and an attack of Neverwinter itself, Traven and Kallos went with some of the Blackdaggers' best fighters into the crypts to take the undead army, and they put Jareth Grim in charge of the Blackdaggers' raids.[1] That year, Melkhor's miners uncovered ancient ruins and statues in Angelhead Mine. Whereas previously the Blackdaggers had cared little for mining and the mines had no other value to them, they now believed they could find treasure too, broke their deal with Melkhor, and refused to make another. The Blackdaggers raided Melkhor's wagons and Krag Foultooth and his bandits assaulted Angelhead, imprisoned and enslaved the miners, and took Melkhor's niece and mine foreman Mira Thamros hostage to ensure his silence and cooperation. Marion Hexbane, meanwhile, sent some of her men to the Broken Crown inn to apply their new leverage on Melkhor.[1] Other victims of the Blackdaggers at the time were Old Len, the lighthouse keeper, whom the bandits robbed; halfling settlers migrating to Neverwinter, who lost their supplies to the bandits; and a group of ghostwise halflings led by Gilern Ghostwise. Cecil Proudfoot recruited a halfling adventurer to aid the latter two. The High Road was left littered with slain bodies and wrecked and looted wagons.[1] However, the Blackdaggers' enemies were not idle. The Neverwinter Guard sent Spycatcher Westband to apprehend Blackdagger spies and retrieve any information they carried; operating out of the Broken Crown inn, he recruited adventurers for this task. The Harpers had their gnoll agent Garl Gnarlclaw work undercover with the Blackdaggers for months, learning much about their operations. They offered their aid to Neverwinter, and Sergeant Alphonse Knox sent the Hero of Sleeping Dragon Bridge to meet the Harper agent Seven Toes at the Broken Crown. Seven Toes in turn had the adventurer find fellow Harper Xalliana, herself a survivor of one of the shipwrecks. Working together, Xalliana and the adventurer disrupted the shipwrecking and salvaging operations at Raven Cliff Beach, defeated Marion Hexbane, and discovered the Blackdaggers' extortion of Melkhor Goldseeker. Finding Melkhor, he admitted what had happened at Angelhead. The adventurer discovered survivors led by Sergeant \"Dusty\" Yates and liberated the mine from Krag Foultooth.[1] Meanwhile, a drow spy of House Xorlarrin worked with the Blackdaggers to provide them with magical weapons and aid. An unnamed drow operative of Bregan D'aerthe learned of this and had a drow adventurer sabotage the delivery at Raven Cliff Beach to make it seem as if the Xorlarrin had double-crossed the Blackdaggers. When the Xorlarrin spy came out of hiding to meet with the Blackdaggers to repair relations, just as the operative planned, he sent the adventurer to slay the spy and her contacts in the abandoned mineshaft they met in.[1] In time, Xalliana discovered Kallos Tam's plot and sent the adventurer to work with Garl Gnarlclaw. With targeted attacks, they thinned their ranks and weakened their command structure. Garl then helped the adventurer infiltrate Grimstorm Keep and slay the bandits' raid leader, Jareth Grim, to sabotage their leadership. Later, he sent a band of adventurers into Cragmire Crypts to seek Xalliana, and found and defeated Traven Blackdagger and Kallos Tam. Finally, Garl and Xalliana were able to move a siege tower close to Blackdagger Keep. With it, they sent a band of adventurers to storm the keep and finally slay Malus Blackdagger before his bandit army could assault Neverwinter. Thanks to these efforts, the Blackdaggers were broken and scattered.[1] Blackdaggers at the beach. By 1479 DR, the Blackdagger Bandits were engaged in a wide range of criminal activities.

They also were known for being able to manipulate flames, hurling it at intruders and causing other fiery effects. Their gating ability allowed them to call upon other hamatula or the assistance of abishai or barbazus.[5]Although always eager to battle, barbed devils disdained weapons, preferring to impale their enemies with their natural weaponry.[5] Those who avoided their attempts to get close would be immobilized through means such as hold person and distant foes would have fire hurled at them.[1][3] Depending on the nature of their mission they would engage in skirmishes or prompt their foes to flee before running after them with claws and fire.[2]Hamatula were the elite guard of the middle layers of Baator, responsible for defending infernal citadels, vaults, and important devils like pit fiends and paeliryons. They often patrolled Minauros and Phlegethos, to catch unauthorized travelers that managed to slip below Avernus and Dis, but also monitored the winding tunnels of Malbolge and Maladomini.[9][2][17] Any trespassers were swiftly locked within one of the innumerable holding cells of Hell.[6]Hamatula were solitary in nature and only worked as a group when compelled to by a stronger baatezu, normally in order to investigate an intruder report. Unlike other devils, hamatulas could not freely traverse between different layers of Hell.[5] It was thought by some that this was a physical limitation, but in truth hamatula were purposefully commanded to patrol a single layer in order to prevent them from wandering too far away from their guard assignments.[9] The fact hamatula could enter certain areas unrestricted made them extremely effective spies and messengers.[9] Other devils acknowledged the tenacity that barbed devils put into their work and considered their paranoid watchfulness a positive trait.[15]When summoned to mortal realms, hamatula were useful as bodyguards, champions and other roles where power was valuable.[2]Hamatulas occasionally studied magic, some practicing enough to cast spells like fireball or flame arrow, although they generally made poor wizards. Along with osyluths, they made up the majority of infernal priests.[18][19]An osyluth achieves his long-desired advancement into a hamatula.Most osyluths that managed to advance were destined to become hamatulas, with only those that managed to show greater skill skipping the stage.[20] The fastest path to success for a hamatula was to give remarkably loyal service to their lords.[5]They possessed glands behind their ears that secreted a hallucinogenic substance. It was most commonly used by greater devils as a torture and interrogation tool, but rumors existed that large quantities of the secretion could produce powerful potions of illusion.[4]Two barbed devils served as cooks in the Dweomercore level of Undermountain.[21]The pit fiend Gazra, being the overseer of the first four layers, had an army of 5,000 hamatula and a personal bodyguard unit comprised of twenty elite hamatula soldiers that he commanded from his crystal castle on Phlegethos.[5] His hamatula also hunted down those that deserted from baatezu armies and searched for signs of corruption among officer corps.[16]The hamatula K'rand Vahlix, was a reserved being and among the few rogues of baatezu society. He was especially rare among the rogues for being a 'risen devil' who supposedly fled to Bytopia after killing his cornugon superior. He worked to organize any reformed fiends during missions that required them to cooperate with archons and other native denizens of the Upper planes, while also rooting out double agent fiends.[22]Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

        "description": "Basilisks had eight legs, which they crawled upon. Basilisks came in a variety of colors from dark gray[2] to dark orange, although they also commonly had a dull brown body with a yellowish underbelly.[3] Basilisks possessed a single row of bony spines that lined their backs and a few had a curved horn atop their noses.[3] Basilisk eyes were, however, the most notable feature, glowing with a pale green light. Adult basilisks could grow to be about 6\u202ffeet (1.8\u202fmeters) in length, not counting the tail, which could reach another 5 to 7\u202ffeet (1.5 to 2.1\u202fmeters). They typically weighed around 300\u202fpounds (140\u202fkilograms).[3]The Bedine called basilisks hagar motab or \"bringers of stone-death\".[8]The greater basilisk was a rare breed of the common basilisk, similar in most respects, except it was larger and with an evil disposition. It was extremely near-sighted, and consequently the range of its petrifying gaze was much shorter.[9]Basilisks had a very slow metabolism, making their movements sluggish and clumsy. As a result, basilisks relied upon their powerful magical characteristics for hunting and were unprepared for a hard pursuit. As a result, prey that fled usually got away unharmed. To prevent this, basilisks typically laired in hidden dens, waiting for any prey unfortunate enough to wander in, even if it was extremely small. Basilisks had a very robust digestive system, however, and could digest even stone. When not hunting, basilisks slept off their meals in their lairs, sometimes in small groups of up to six individuals.[3]Basilisks were lazy and cowardly creatures, but evilly cunning. They made their lairs in dark underground caves where there was a ready and easily accessible food and water supply. They were easy to anger, though they never fought to the death if it could be helped. They were observed to be irrational and possibly insane half the time but shrewd hunters the other half. When hunting, they pounced from hiding and attacked with their petrifying gaze and vicious bite. They only needed to eat one large meal (the size of a deer or a humanoid) a month, owing to their slow metabolisms, though would apparently gorge themselves to death if provided with enough meat.[8]Basilisks spent much of their time asleep basking, either in the heat of the sun, or, if that was too harsh, in the heat of some other source, such as a volcanic vent, or even a campfire. If the basilisk was unable to warm itself for more than a day, it would become sluggish, ultimately dying of hypothermia after a further three days.[10]Though thought by many to be incapable of eating a petrified victim,[11] at least after infancy (immature basilisks had been observed by scholars devouring chunks of statues, but not adults),[8] all basilisks were in fact capable of eating their petrified prey due to their strong jaws and a process within their gullet that transformed the stone back into flesh.[1]When angered, they hissed like a cobra.[8]Basilisks were known for their ability to petrify their prey, causing a chemical change in the body that turned victims into a porous stone statue.[11] Sages theorized that the creature's eyes emitted some kind of radiation that was absorbed by the eyes of their victim, but ultimately, the precise method of how their power worked was very poorly understood.[11] It has been noted that the better the eyesight of the victim, the longer the effective range of the basilisk's gaze, and multiple reports claim that the casters of arcane eye spells, the users of crystal balls, and the wearers of eyes of the eagle have all fallen victim to petrification upon viewing basilisks over great distances.[10] Creatures in gaseous form however, were apparently immune.[11] Items carried or worn by their prey were not turned to stone, only the body itself. However, protective magic items still worn by the statue would continue to affect it as they would if the victim was still flesh and blood.[11] Creatures petrified by a basilisk were not dead, but placed into a form of permanent suspended animation some called \"stone sleep\". While petrified, the statue could be damaged, just as natural stone could be.[11]A basilisk's eyes were also capable of viewing the astral and ethereal planes, though not at the same time, and only if they concentrated to do so. Their gaze also worked against creatures on these planes, killing creatures on the astral, and turning those on the ethereal into a different kind of \"ethereal\" stone.[11] On the material plane, they could see both the infrared, and ultraviolet spectrums of light, granting them darkvision.[11]A basilisk attacking a target.Given a higher-than-average food supply, a basilisk could regrow lost limbs and tails within one to four months.[10]Basilisks were known to eat mammals, birds, fish, some berries,[11] and even other reptiles.[3]Basilisks could be found nearly everywhere, including subterranean biomes. Typically, basilisks sheltered within burrows, caves, or other similar areas. These dens were sometimes distinguished by what appeared to be statues, although these were, in fact, creatures that had been petrified by the gaze of the creature.[3] Despite their adaptability, and although they still lived in such places, they didn't appear to thrive in cold climes,[1] presumably due to their cold-blooded nature.[10]Beyond the Prime Material plane, scattered numbers of basilisks could be found in the Elemental Plane of Earth.[12]Basilisks instinctively avoided looking directly at others of their kind, but were able to recognize them using hearing and a sense of smell that was capable of differentiating between individual basilisks. Basilisks were mature enough to breed at the age of only nine months. Once they had found a mate, the pair would find a body of water to breed in (the water helped support their body weight), then both travelled to the lair of one of the pair.[11]One or two days after the act, the female would lay one to eight greenish-white eggs, each about the size of a human's fist, which the mother would then half-bury in cool sand or mud.[10]The eggs themselves had malleable and somewhat stretchy shells, able to be handled and moved easily without risk to the gestating creature inside.[10]There was a one-in-twenty chance that an egg was infertile, but otherwise an infant would hatch from it's egg between thirty one and fifty days after it had been lain. During this time period, neither parent ate, causing them to become increasingly aggravated. Newly hatched, a basilisk could be anywhere between one[8] and nine inches long. They would grow almost to their full adult length within four to six months.[10]The parents would share a lair until the resulting offspring were themselves old enough to breed, then they would separate. However, they would instinctively seek each other out again four summers hence and mate again. Basilisks mated for life.[11]A frozen greater basilisk served as a guardian for a Lockstone placed atop Stoner's Needle in the Sword Coast lands, having been set there by the extraplanar being Imgig Zu to prevent the fire elemental Jogaoh (who'd been trapped in the form of a dwarf by Imgig Zu) from regaining his freedom. Jogaoh feared the basilisk too much to make the climb up and take the Lockstone. When Vajra Valmeyjar, Cybriana, Timoth Eyesbright, Onyx the Invincible, and Priam Agrivar sought out Jogaoh in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, he agreed to help them provided they retrieved the Lockstone for him. Atop the tower, Jogaoh took the Lockstone and was restored to his fire elemental form, then returned to the planes before the basilisk awoke to attack Vajra and Priam. Vajra slew the basilisk, using the reflection of the gem so it would turn itself to stone.[13]The Purple Basilisk laired in the hideaway known as the Auantiver Labyrinth, and the group who called themselves the Men of the Basilisk had potential recruits try to escape it's lair as a form of initiation.[14]A basilisk dwelt in the western forests of Wyllowwood, a layer of Undermountain.[15]The eyes and gullets of basilisks were of great value to alchemists and mages. The pupils, lenses, and fluid of basilisk eyes could be made into spell inks and potion ingredients as well as used in the creation of magic items concerned with petrification.[10] The fluids found in a basilisk's gullet could be used by an alchemist to create an oil that would restore a petrified creature to flesh as well.[1]Intact basilisk eggs, recently hatched infants, and mature specimens were also in demand from those who thought to use the creatures as guardians of locations and treasure (though it's said that most such attempts to utilize basilisks as guards ends in failure).[10]An intact eyeball could be sold for up to 1,000 gold pieces, while just an eyelid could still fetch as much as 400gp. An egg could sell for up to 500gp, while a hatched infant could go for 700gp. A mature specimen was less valuable than small one, but buyers often still pay up to 500gp for them.",

        "description": "Most bats were roughly the size of a small bird although larger bats existed. All bats were adept at perceiving their surroundings in the dark though the precise mechanics differed by species, with most bats using a form of blindsight,[6] or darkvision in the case of shadowhunter bats.[5]There were many varieties of unusual bat species, some of which are listed below:A bat in flight.Beyond the Prime Material plane, bats could be found in the Domains of Dread and some claimed that they were more numerous there than in any other plane of existence.[13] Bats also inhabited the caverns of the Blood Tor, the Abyssal realms of Beshaba and Umberlee.[14]Some magic stores were known to sell the fur and guano of bats as a sort of material component, both at a price of 10 gp per 1\u202foz (28\u202fg).[15]Circa 1365 DR, the owner of the restaurant Maid of the Moors in Mornbryn's Shield, Beldora Thiiruin kept pet bats she allowed freely fly around the dining hall, she used the flying critters and means of pest control.[16]Halfling kids often fished for bats using a light, durable twine string, and bait of live moths.[17]",

        "description": "Barbazus were the second-lowest[4][7][8][9] in the hierarchy of lesser devils,[4][5][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] sharing the same rank as kocrachons[8][9] and, according to the wizard Mordenkainen, merregons.[12]Barbazus were 6\u202fft (1.8\u202fm) tall, often green-skinned humanoids, with roughly 225\u202flb (102\u202fkg), muscled bodies.[3][15] Their signature feature was their disgusting, wiry beards, which were occasionally infested with white maggots, although they could also be recognized by their pointed ears and long tails.[4][15] Their skin was moist but covered in scales, and despite having clawed hands and feet they almost always carried massive saw-toothed glaives.[4]Barbazu were volatile and violent, attacking at the slightest provocation and exploiting any opportunity to go on the offensive. They were extremely cruel, fighting not because of loyalty to the system or fellowship with their kin, but out of a need to injure, kill, and terrify.[4][2] They were followers by nature as they were too reckless and simpleminded to lead, being potentially the most chaotic of the baatezu.[4] Slaughter and maiming was their primary approach to interacting with mortals, as opposed to the subtle temptations and deceptions found in other devils.[2] Barbazu had a personal attachment to their glaives and would stubbornly insist on keeping them even if offered one of superior quality.[16]The beard of a barbazu contained a dangerous disease known as the 'devil chills', which caused those struck to develop a painfully burning rash.[3][5] If not lashing out with their claws and beards, a barbazu could attempt to summon abishai, lemures, or simply additional barbazus. Barbazus could also whip themselves into a dangerous battle frenzy not unlike that of a barbarian, fearlessly rampaging throughout the battlefield with no regard to personal safety. As a battle raged on, they were more and more likely to enter such a state and would stay enraged unless stopped or removed from the battle.[3][4]A barbazu legion holding formation against a dretch horde.Being the combat-craving creatures that they were, barbazus took every opportunity to engage in battle and often refused to stop until their opponents were slain.[4] Their tactics were fairly direct, although they were trained to use teamwork to defend allies in the heat of battle.[2] Most barbazus were armed with a saw-toothed glaive with a backward-curving, treble hook at its base. While the blade itself serrated their foes and caused them to bleed profusely, the hook could be used to drag back fleeing enemies.[3][5] Due to their attachment to their own glaives, they normally refused to fight with their claws unless they were unable to use them.[16]Bearded devils were the elite assault troops of the archdevils that fought shoulder-to-shoulder at the front of lemure hordes.[1][3] They were deployed in the legions of Hell's middle circles, particularly in Minauros, by the thousands either to guard Baator from outside incursions or attack the armies of the Abyss.[4][5] Always found as the muscle for a more devious villain, they were also employed as guards for greater baatezu or their treasure and lands.[2][4] Amnizus were commonly protected by groups of barbazus, although they were more fond of employing war devils because of their greater intelligence.[17]Barbazu were also responsible for locating and ferrying new souls off the Shelves of Despond to the domains of their respective lords. After reaching the blood-drenched islands on Avernus, they would sniff out which archdevil owned the soul based on the lower-ranked devil responsible for their corruption, as all souls that went to the Nine Hells were specially stained with a mark of corruption. Occasionally, however, it was unclear what a soul's destination should be, a rare occurrence as normally there were marked territories in the mortal realms determining such a thing even when no devil interfered with their damnation. In such a scenario, barbazus serving different lords broke out into frenzied bartering sessions that often broke down into outright brawls, and any barbazu that successfully took such unmarked souls to their archdevils were credited for the capture and thus increased their chances for promotion. Such a situation also made it possible for the soul to escape or be stolen by a third party, and the servitors of lawful evil deities could also be found negotiating for unclaimed souls with the barbazus.[18]From left to right: a chain devil, a bone devil, and a bearded devil.The bearded devils were bred for battle, and all other devils recognized their worth in combat situations. Yet they also had a bad reputation with other devils for their impulsive nature that frequently got them brutally disciplined. Despite leading the charge in infernal armies, they never commanded such forces even though they were lesser baatezu. Barbazus were very rarely promoted because they suffered incredible losses during the Blood War, with their overall role being that of expendable savages. Most baatezu were never promoted again after reaching the rank of barbazu, with excellent red abishai and spinagons skipping the rank altogether and only those bearded devils of exceptional merit rising to the only stage they could from that point, that of the osyluths.[9][4]In 1480 DR, assassins and barbazu attacked Lasparhall in Thentia in an attempt to assassinate the rightful ruling family of Hulburg, the Hulmasters.[19]Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

        "description": "A behir was often mistaken for a wingless blue dragon.[6] It had a long, snake-like body and could slither on the ground like a snake, but it also had six pairs of legs upon which it could walk or climb if it chose to do so.[3][4] Each of a behir's twelve feet contained three clawed toes.[6] They began life with six or eight legs and grew additional legs as they aged. They grew about 8\u202ffeet (2.4\u202fmeters) per year.[4]Behirs had thick, armored scales, much like a dragon. Their scales were colored in variations of dark blue, being lighter on their undersides.[3][4]They had long narrow heads,[6] crocodilian in shape,[4] with curved, black horns on the top,[6][3] which were used for preening.[3][4] Behirs were born horn-less.[8] Their mouths were full of many sharp multi-colored translucent teeth that were valued for their gem-like beauty,[6][9] and their bones were crystalline.[10]Newborn behirs were about 2\u202ffeet (0.61\u202fmeters) in length,[4] while the typical adult behir was around 40\u202ffeet (12\u202fmeters)[3][4] and weighed about 4,000\u202fpounds (1,800\u202fkilograms).[3] Behirs reached adulthood at the age of ten and like other reptilian creatures would continue to grow throughout their lifetimes, having to shed their scales periodically..[6] Because of this behirs could sometimes reach gargantuan sizes.[3]Behirs were known to be expert climbers.[3][4] They were surprisingly quick, and could outrun the typical human.[6][3]Behirs could breath a magical burst of electricity from their mouths, much like a blue dragon. (They themselves were completely immune to damage from electricity.)[3][4] There were some reports that they were immune to poisons as well.[4]If a behir grabbed a hold of an opponent or prey with its mouth, it had several options. It could wrap its body around the victim and constrict, it could tear at the victim with its many clawed limbs, or it could simply swallow the victim whole.[3][4]A behir having a giggle.Behirs were usually solitary creatures, but could be found in mated pairs,[3][4] though this only lasted until their eggs were hatched.[4] They were most active during the day.[6] And during the winter months they hibernated.[6]Mating took place in early spring. Females produced between one and four blue-green, leathery eggs, which were buried under dirt or sand.[6] There were conflicting reports about how long it took for their eggs to hatch. Some sources claimed it took eight months for them to hatch.[4] Others insisted that it only took three or four weeks.[6] The young were driven from the den soon after hatching.[6]Behirs were a carnivorous species. Their main diet consisted of medium-sized animals, such as boars.[6]Behirs preferred to live in warm, hilly terrain.[3] They made dens in caves\u2014which were often in the side of high cliffs[4]\u2014or hidden thickets.[6] A behir's territory usually encompassed an area of 400\u2011square-mile (1,000,000,000\u2011square-meter).[4]Despite their nature, behirs were popular subjects of breeding in Halruaa. The varieties of brhir breeds was as diverse as the breeder's imagination allowed. They varied in size, color, and were used as guard dogs, or small hand-held pets. Behir hatcheries consisted of long shallow pools of water. They were fed with fish and eels. Those behir not sold alive were butchered and used for its material component and crafting materials.[8]Behirs were capable of speaking both Common[3] and the Draconic language..[1]Behirs sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and were seen as good omens by his followers.[12]Behirs hated all dragons and would refuse to share any territory with them.[3][4]Behir horns could be used to make the ink necessary for scribing a magic scroll for a lightning bolt spell. Similarly, a scroll of neutralize poison often used ink from a behir's talons, and that of protection from poison used ink made from a behir's heart.[4]Behir scales were sometimes used to make armor, much like the hides of dragons.[4] Behir crystalline bones were used for scrimshaw. Bone-carved chimes, sculptures, and musical instruments were very common across Halruaan cities. Behir teeth were as beautiful and valuable as gemstones and had a wide variety of creative uses. One such use was a strange type of Haluaan music box that were invented at the Behir's Nest shop in Khaerbaal. Behir teeth formed plucking hooks that pulled on string made of behir guts and electrum, while behir ivory was used for other parts of these wondrous instruments.[10]In 1492 DR, a behir dwelt on the Troglodyte Warrens level of Undermountain.[13]In the city of Memnon, an inn called the Brazen Behir had a lifelike statue of a behir that formed its main gate.[18]",

These individuals lived in close-knit groups, often found in less-civilized locales.[5] They looked out for their own kind within these communities.[6]Berserkers focused their efforts on honing their skill with melee weapons and forewent training with those wielded at long range. Similarly, they eschewed most types of armor more cumbersome than splint mail.[6]A berserker's rage lasted until every enemy on the battlefield was downed. On occasion they could not differentiate friend from foe and would attack those who were in fact their allies. Afterwards, a berserker became physically exhausted and vulnerable to certain effects they shrugged off during their rage.[7]The Rashemaar berserkers comprised several tribes of fearsome warriors from the far-eastern realm of Rashemen.[4][8]",

They were excellent swimmers and often made their lairs in submerged caves or underground chambers near swamps or murky ponds. Their lairs always had two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp or pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth.[12]Female dragons took the lead when it came to breeding, choosing their mate largely based on the size of the hoard of prospective males. Because of this, male black dragons would often brag about their accumulated wealth to communicative creatures or others of their own kind, in the hopes that rumors of their hoard would spread to any females in the area that were looking to mate. When two or more females selected the same male as their partner, they would fight for dominance high in the air above the lair of the male, allowing him to gaze upon his future mate's victory in admiration.[9]Black dragons were not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them personally. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while growing, which helped protect the dragon as well.[13] Black dragons would only protect their young so long as that responsibility didn't threaten their own life. If they had to choose between saving their own life or those of their clutch or spawn, they would most certainly choose the former; though they would assuredly seek revenge afterwards.[9]Black dragon wyrmling.A black dragon's diet consisted of fish, mollusks, aquatic critters and some red meat from terrestrial animals.[12]The skies over the southwestern Bay of Chessenta and southern Chondalwood have been the source of multiple sightings of black dragons. Reports from the jungles of Chult of dense, multi-layered tropical forest complete with its own ecosystem, were highlighted with tales of black dragons living within the canopy.[10]The iconography of the Purple Dragon Knights of Cormyr stemmed from the legend of the great black dragon Thauglor, who once dominated the area upon which the kingdom was built.[14]Black dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and were seen as good omens by his followers.[15]A black dragon demonstrating its acid breath.Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "The average black pudding measured 15 ft (4.6 m) across and 2 ft (0.6 m) thick and they weighed around 18,000 lb (8.2 mt).[3] While most of these monsters were an inky black, some could be brown, grey, and even white.[5] In underground locations, these creatures appeared as dark blobs.[1]Some black puddings that managed to survive for a very long time came to be known as elder black puddings, they were significantly bigger than their younger counterparts and had almost impenetrable outer layer of aged material. These ancient black puddings were immune to all damage, unless the outer layers were dissolved first by a very specific concoction.[7]These creatures were mindless underground-dwelling hunters and scavengers that wandered and absorbed whatever they found.[5][4][3] A black pudding would position itself in a dungeon hallway like a shadow and wait for unsuspecting prey.[1]Black pudding attacked by grabbing, grappling, and constricting prey directly into their liquid-esque mass. Like other oozes, they also secreted a deadly acidic substance which strongly and quickly dissolved weapons, clothing, and organic tissue alike. When slashed at or pierced, the black pudding split into two smaller puddings, both of which would do the same; this continued until they were too small and weak to do so further.[3] A black pudding would eat bone, metal, and wood leaving only stone behind.[1]Like other oozes, black pudding desire warmth and sense their prey through movement. While the creatures seek living and breathing targets, they will feast on animal guts, slime, and mushrooms.[8]Black puddings could be found inhabiting shrines and temples dedicated to Ghaunadaur, the drow deity of oozes. The worshipers of the deity cultivated alliances with black pudding for mutual defense.[9]Circa 1490 DR, the especially huge ancient Elder black pudding created a lair for itself in the Noxious Chasm just outside of Luskan that served as the city's sewer's exhaust. The significant age of the creature granted it an almost impenetrable crust of aged material making it almost invincible. The Elder has been disposed of using Relona's anti-pudding dissolving agent that dissolved its aged armor making it vulnerable.[7]In 1492 DR, a black ooze could be found hiding on a statue in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain.[10]",

They were very fast and maneuverable. They were stubborn fighters, continuing to attack a target even if they suffered injuries.[3]Evil bird maidens in Zakhara were known to shapeshift into blood hawks.[6]Male blood hawks often took gems from the corpses of their prey, which they used to decorate their nests to attract females.[3]Blood hawks were obligate carnivores and hunted humanoids, particularly humans. They got their name from their habit of consuming as much fresh blood as possible.[5]Outside of Faerun, blood hawks were known to be encountered in various deserts in Maztica.[7]Beyond the Prime Material plane, blood hawks could be found in the plane of Acheron.[8]Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

        "description": "A review of blue dragon anatomy.Blue dragons were physically distinguished by the single large horn protruding from their heads and also by their ears, which were rather large and frilled. The neck is short and broad, with spines growing from it. The tail is thick and bumpy, like that of a crocodile. The wings are more pronounced than most other species'. They smelled like electricity or sand.The blue dragon excelled at aerial combat, perhaps more so than any other species of dragon. Their lightning discharges were very easy to aim at other aerial foes, or at creatures below them on the ground. They were also extremely adept at burrowing in sand, and often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they were so burrowed, their large horns could easily be mistaken for pointed desert rocks.Blue dragons used a shocking burst of lightning.Blue dragons were native to arid wastelands and deserts. They made their lairs in underground caves; easily accessible to the dragons, as they could burrow through the ground. These dragons would fly above their territory, using the bleak landscape and its sparse terrain features as their best chance of spotting opponents. The typical blue dragon lair was dug into one of the towering rock formations that dominate desert landscapes. As with all dragon lairs, the blue dragon's lair would have two entrances: one at ground level and hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it could perch and survey its territory. Each lair also had a large subterranean cavern with a large pool of water and a sandy beach, which its inhabitant would use for drinking and relaxation.Despite their evil nature, blue dragons were actually excellent parents to their young, and would rarely leave their eggs unattended. Blue dragon eggs must be buried in warm sand to incubate.

        "description": "Boars were covered in thick fur, often brown or grayish in color. The exact size of a boar varied from species to species, from roughly human size to roughly the mass of an ogre or similarly sized creature. All varieties of boars were armed with sharp tusks that jutted out from beneath their snout and which were capable of causing serious injury. Boars also had a highly developed sense of smell.[7]Though not predatory by nature, boars were ill-tempered and territorial, a combination made worse by boars' powerful musculature and sharp tusks.[7]There existed several species of boar in the Realms, some of which are listed below.A dire boar (right) and a thunderfury boar (left).Boars usually traveled in groups known as sounders.[5]Boars were found in most locales across the world, from chilly tundras to hot jungles.[5]In north Faer\u00fbn, wild boars inhabited the medium woods of Cormanthor, Daggerdale, and Shadowdale. Particularly the Border Forest and Vale of Lost Voices.[8] They could also be found in the Marsh of Chelimber,[9] the forests of Mistledale, around the Pool of Yeven,[10] and in the Ardeep Forest.[11][12][note 1] They were found throughout the Savage Frontier.[13]In interior Faer\u00fbn found in Cormyr, while in west Faer\u00fbn they could be found in Tethyr[14] and in Amn, where they were so common along the Trade Way near the Battlescarred Bard inn that some believed a local landowner must have been using a deepspawn to create them.[15] They were also particularly common throughout the forests of the Vast.[16] In the Unapproachable East, they could be found in the Forest of Lethyr and Yuirwood.[17] In the Hordelands, they could be found on the Katakoro Plateau[18] High Meadows,[19] and Central Steppe.[20] In the land of Anauroch, they could be found in the fertile reaches of the Plain of Standing Stones[21] as well as the bordering Desertsmouth Mountains.[22]Beyond Faer\u00fbn they could be found on the island of Evermeet, where they were non-hostile towards elves and occasionally hunted by gold elves.[23] On the continent of Laerakond, boars could be found in Eskorn, Fimbrul, and Relmaur.[24] In Zakhara they could be found in the land's hills and badlands.[25]Beyond the Prime Material plane, boars could be found in the Feywild,[5] on Yggdrasil,[26] the Cavern of Rest. They were particularly known to act as guards in this divine realm of Marthammor Duin.[27][28]A dwarven mosaic floor depicting a boar, found in the House of Gems of Myth Drannor.A petrified boar was kept on the Arcane Chambers level of Undermountain by Halaster.[42]Members of the church of Silvanus often encouraged the hunting and eating of boar under the belief that the nobles who owned forests which were good for hunting would take efforts to preserve or expand those woodlands.[14]",

The putrid stench of rot surrounded their fearsome forms.[4]Osyluths were malicious sadists that reveled in the pain of lesser creatures, yet still exercised a patient vigilance and cunning.[1][2][5] They were almost entirely driven by a diverse array of negative emotions, including lust, jealousy, hatred, and fury, towards all other beings. The suffering of defiant inferiors was particularly delightful to them, but at the same time were bitter towards their own superiors for their status.[1][4] They were expected to show absolute adherence to the tenets of baatezu morality and to the will of their masters, with most being fanatically loyal or at least obedient, and encouraged other baatezu to show similar levels of viciousness and zeal.[2][4]Osyluths capable of exuding an aura of fear within a 5\u202fft (1.5\u202fm) radius of themselves to send their foes running in panic.[4] Their other innately magical abilities allowed them to fly, turn themselves invisible, craft powerful illusions, and create a wall of ice. They were also capable of summoning somewhere between 1-100 nupperibos, a small group of lemures or spinagons, or up to two other osyluths.[3][4]Driven into combat by ruthless rage, osyluths violently lashed out with tooth and claw, surrounding themselves with terror to keep their enemies from fighting back.[2][4] Although capable of fighting unarmed, they often wielded hooked polearms constructed from bones to snare and wound their foes.[5] Once their opponents' bodies were restrained and their resolve shattered, a bone devil could fully subdue them with their tail venom.[1][2] They normally focused on singular foes and divided groups using their wall of ice.[2][3]The function of the osyluths was similar to that of a police force, specifically a moral police force, as they were responsible for rooting out the decay of infernal virtues within Baator.[9] They monitored the activities of other devils, vigilantly reporting their activities and ensuring their obedience.[3] Their role as taskmasters was taken extremely seriously, as they constantly sought to inspire other devils to uphold the ideals of lawful evil through brutal disciplinary action and severe motivational techniques.[2][9]They mostly congregated on the lower circles of Hell, especially Stygia, and also made up the bulk of Mammon's personal servants along with hamatula.[5][7] They often roamed the layers of Hell, occasionally grouping together as inquisitors, to exterminate heresy and force hesitant baatezu into battle. When brought to the mortal realms under the command of dictators and tyrants, their talent for spotting disloyalty and incompetence, in even small amounts, was abundantly clear.[2]As the only baatezu with authority over those of higher rank, osyluths were also among the most hated. Rather than the supervision itself, the method of punishment accessible to bone devils meant that most baatezu with a chance of getting away with it would kill them. If through whatever enigmatic interrogation methods they found a devil guilty of breaking baatezu law, they had permission to send an offender to the Pit of Flame on Phlegethos. Once sent there, the offender would experience the agonizing infernal energies of the Pit for one hundred and one days before being returned to their former positions, having presumably learned their lesson.[9]If however, the criminal attempted to kill an osyluth and was caught a much more frightening punishment was enacted. The attempted killer was transformed into a lemure and branded with a mark denoting that they were never to be promoted again, and such lemures were hated by all other baatezu. Osyluths were believed to be the agents of the pit fiends, but regardless of the truth of such a claim, their disciplinary jurisdiction over higher-ranking baatezu stopped at them.[9]While the Dark Eight were the ones in charge of the promotion of gelugons to pit fiends, the bone devils held an important role in the decision. Every century, one hundred osyluths joined in a moot named after the deceased founder of the Dark Eight, Cantrum. The osyluths gathered in a ring around the Dark Eight presenting their various reports on the moral character and competency of gelugons promising enough to be considered. The hundred osyluths had a single combined vote within the process.[4]An osyluth achieves his long-desired advancement into a hamatula.After the Ring of Cantrum concluded 1,000 osyluths were promoted into hamatula and 1,000 lower-ranking devils were turned into osyluths. To counteract this guaranteed advancement system osyluths who surpassed the usual high standards of their station advanced into amnizu.[4] Somehow this fact became distorted to the point where most mortals believed that only 1,000 osyluths existed at once, a rumor possibly started by other devils in order to make the caste seem weak.[9]When an osyluth was promoted to an amnizu, it underwent a process that was potentially lethal. The process consisted of racking, drawing, and quartering. When the osyluth got quartered, it naturally lost its limbs, but new smaller ones regrew. Once every limb was gone and replaced with a smaller one, the skin of the face was peeled to create a cowl that the would-be-amnizu had to remove through will-power, lest it died.[15]Because the merrenoloths refused to partake in the Blood War, it sometimes fell to the few osyluths that tried to learn the twists of the River Styx to become the boatmen of the baatezu. However, as Baatorian history accounts tried to cover up, entire fleets had been lost in the past to waterfalls, whirlpools, and rocks when the osyluth steering the navy made a wrong turn or misread one of the signs of the Styx, so ultimately the devils were reliant on the yugoloths for safe passage.[16]A trio of inquisitive osyluth priests.Osyluth had the necessary mental capacity to learn wizardry, possessing a talent for the art of divination that was commonly used to aid them in their duties, although only a rare few bothered learning magic. Another branch of magic osyluths pursued was that of divine magic tied to a deity. While the overall number of baatezu priests was small, osyluths made up a substantial fraction of them and were always specialty priests.[17][18]Befitting beings that primarily occupied Stygia, osyluths preferred cold environments as opposed to hot ones. They were capable of seeing into the ultraviolet spectrum due to their chilling environment.[5]Osyluths were capable of seeing in both total darkness[1][3] and in the ultraviolet spectrum.[5] Their most fearsome natural armament were their scorpion-like tails. Said tails injected a potent, strength-sapping poison into their victims, quickly rendering most powerless.[4]The famed Paladin Kern Desanea, the \"Hammerseeker\", fought with an osyluth during his adventures in the Moonsea region.[19]A mage from Dweomercore named Yarek summoned a bone devil to kill a rival, Skrianna Shadowdusk. The osyluth agreed, but then murdered him, while still seeking to fulfill its contract.[20]Strezgag the CracklingLeast: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

        "description": "A review of brass dragon anatomy.Physically, the brass dragon was highly distinctive. From below, its outstretched wings formed a triangular shape, as they were attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings were longest at the shoulder, and tapered gently as they reached the tail. Their scales seemed to radiate heat and light. As their name implied, brass dragons tended to have brass-colored scales. Their scales were a dull brown at a young age, becoming more glossy and brass-like in appearance as they aged. The shape of the head was quite unusual, as it included a large, curved plate that extended from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and curved upwards into two points. They had two sharp horns on the chin, which became steadily pointier as the dragon aged. They smelled like metal.[6]Brass dragons very rarely engaged in combat, preferring to talk rather than fight. If they considered a creature threatening, they would subdue it with their sleeping gas. In the face of true danger, a younger brass dragon would have most likely flown away and hidden in the sand. It would have fought and used its fire breath only as an absolute last resort. Older brass dragons preferred to avoid combat but would fight if they had the tactical advantage[7]Brass dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a narrow line of fire, and the second was a cone of sleep gas.[5]Brass dragons hunted their prey while flying, mainly consuming antelope, mountain goats and sheep. Only evil brass dragons hunted intelligent creatures. Brass dragons have evolved for living in the desert and therefore can go long periods without water.[8]A stuffed young brass dragon was kept in the Obstacle Course level of Undermountain.[9]Brass dragons were native to arid regions; they shared many similar habitats with blue dragons, which often led to conflict. The brass dragon preferred to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also preferred to have the bulk of their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun would warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon's lair was well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders.[6] The centerpiece of any brass dragon's lair was the Grand Conversation Hall, where it spent the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. A typical lair also contained an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon collected, a sleeping chamber, and a storage room. All brass dragon lairs had several small entrances, known as bolt holes. These multiple entrances allowed a brass dragon to easily escape an attack by a blue dragon or other predator.[citation needed]Brass dragon eggs were incubated in a nest of open flames. Incubation took approximately 480 days.[10] The eggs were typically tended by both parents, so that they could talk together as they maintained their vigil. The newly hatched brass wyrmling was not remarkable in appearance; its scales were a dull brown. The scales became lighter and more brilliant as the dragon matured. Brass wyrmlings probably learned to talk more quickly than the young of any other sapient species. They talked constantly about anything and everything, and they would talk to anybody: friends, family, enemies and small creatures that could not talk back, or even to itself if nobody else was near. When exposed to a new language, a brass wyrmling would usually become fluent in under an hour.[citation needed]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "A review of bronze dragon anatomy.Physically, the bronze dragon was quite fierce in appearance, despite its good nature. While most of its body was a reflective bronze color, the wings were often tipped with green. The dragon had four large horns on each side of their heads, three protruding from each cheek and one from the top of their head, pointing back towards the tail. The tips of these points were black and very sharp, and were often used for grooming. The tongue was purple-gray, long and pointed, and not forked. A large frill ran down the upper part of its neck.[citation needed]Bronze dragons smelled like sea spray.[6]These dragons possessed the ability to alter their form, assuming the appearance of any type of animal or humanoid creature they choose. As such, many could have encountered a bronze dragon without ever being the wiser. A friendly dolphin that saved a drowning child; a mercenary sailor eager to fight pirates; a diver specializing in searching undersea shipwrecks for possible treasure\u2026 all of these could have been a bronze dragon. Many bronze dragons would use their shape-shifting abilities to get close to an enemy target; bronze dragons prefer melee combat.[citation needed]Bronze dragons could speak with animals, create food and water, make fog, control water and weather, and detect thought.[citation needed]While bronze dragons were often fascinated with battles, especially fighting to defeat evil, they had strong moral compunctions against killing living beings unless absolutely necessary. They would often join good-aligned armies to fight the forces of evil, either in human form or their own. In battle, their weapon of choice was to breathe repulsion gas, which is so putrid that it forced absolutely everything away. They also liked to relocate a foe to a remote location where it could do no harm when possible. When absolutely forced to kill, the bronze dragon was a deadly combatant, roasting enemies with bursts of lightning or ripping them open with its clawed forelegs.[citation needed]Bronze dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of electricity similar to a lightning bolt, and the second was either a cone of gas that affected the minds of creatures caught in it, causing them to flee for a short time,[7] or a cone of repulsion energy which physically pushed enemies away.[1]They truly enjoyed observing and interacting with smaller creatures, most especially humans. They often went out of their way to help them, such as rescuing humans from a shipwreck or a dangerous foe. In many of these instances, the bronze dragon would transform itself into a human, so that those who it helped never knew who really did the rescuing. They would never seek payment for their help, in any form. They always sought justice as best they could, and could not abide to see any creature being treated with cruelty of any sort. The older the dragon, the more pronounced the passion for justice became. They were probably the most social species of dragon, and often swam and played together in groups. They also loved to attend human festivals and parties, although usually in human form. The bronze dragons were spiritually connected to silver dragons as they have similar personalities and were each involved in an ancient ritual.[citation needed]Bronze dragons were often found along the coastal regions of the world. They liked to dwell along the sea, to make use of their aquatic abilities, while staying close to humanoid settlements. Many ship merchants would pay a bronze dragon to protect their trade routes. More nefarious bronze dragons would demand bribes for \u201cprotection\u201d while accepting similar bribes from pirates to operate within their territories. Given its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair was quite naturally underwater, and was often disguised with seaweed and coral. The bulk of the lair was above water level, however, consisting of multiple tunnels and large chambers, some as much as a thousand feet above sea level. They preferred to make their lairs in an island volcano, if possible.[citation needed]A bronze dragon wyrmlingBronze dragons mated for life, and took their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness. They protected their eggs and their wyrmlings at any cost. Although bronze dragons always lived near water, they laid their eggs in a dry cave. Apart from a dry, relatively warm environment, bronze dragon eggs required no special conditions for incubation like those of most dragons. Upon hatching, the wyrmlings were raised, taught, and protected by their parents. A newly-hatched bronze wyrmling appeared yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales gradually shifted to bronze as it matured. Bronze wyrmlings loved to swim in the ocean, and frolic in much the same manner as dolphins.[citation needed]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

They took their name from their noses and claws, which were similar to those of bears.[11] Their claws were not long and sharp enough to be used as weapons, so bugbears often armored and armed themselves with a variety of purloined gear,[3] which was normally second-rate and in poor repair.[10]Bugbears, like other goblinoids, had a reputation for being dim-witted and brutish. This claim was not unfounded, and like their kin bugbears had easily provoked tempers and were prone to rages. Few bugbears overcame this flaw and their culture's brutal nature.[12] Many bugbears were chaotic evil in alignment, favoring stealth and surprising their opponents.[10]Bugbear heroes, though rare, were heard of and could acquire significant renown if successful. Often the motivation for this change of heart came from the rewards earned from virtue, which in the long term were more pleasing than the short-term pleasures of evil behaviors.[12]Balsag and his two giant rats standing guard in an underground chamber near Thundertree.Bugbears were often found in the company of other goblinoids, particularly goblins, since tribes made up mostly of hobgoblins and bugbears tended to be wiped out quickly by other races as a precaution.[12] Some bugbears also operated independently, though tribes ruled by hobgoblins were better organized and less savage. This was in part because bugbears had little patience for diplomacy or negotiation, preferring violent solutions to conflicts unless obviously overpowered.[2]Bugbears once had their own pantheon, led by Hruggek. Bugbears often decapitated their enemies as a way to honor Hruggek, who was said to do the same.[2] From the Spellplague to the Second Sundering, the power of Hruggek was diminished and the god served as an exarch of Bane, the god of tyranny.[13] However, after the Second Sundering, bugbears began to follow bugbear-specific deities such as Hruggek once more.[9]Other bugbear deities included Grankhul, the bugbear deity of hunting, senses, stealth, and surprise;[14][15] and Skiggaret. Local pantheons often included a god of earth, a god of fertility, and a god of death.[16]Like many goblinoids, bugbears spoke the Goblin language.[10]Unlike most creatures, bugbears were particularly susceptible to the effects of Bowen's flowers, which would knock them out within minutes.[17]Many scholars of the late 14th century DR believed that bugbears and goblins were both bred by the hobgoblins as slave races, with bugbears serving as elite soldiers.[2]Nine bugbears working for the Xanathar Thieves' Guild dwelt upon the Dungeon Level of Undermountain.[18]Four bugbears working for Yek dwelt in the Arcane Chambers Level of Undermountain, as well as twenty bugbears who served the Xanathar Thieves' Guild.[19]Eight bugbears dwelt in Azrok's Hold, on the Sargauth Level of Undermountain.[20]",

Its head was bullet-shaped, similar to that of a shark, with a massive mouth filled with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth.[citation needed]Bulettes were sometimes supposed to be a bizarre cross between an armadillo and a snapping turtle, though there was little evidence to support this theory. Bulettes were heavily armored, however, like either creature, and had a powerful jaw mechanism for snapping up their unsuspecting prey.[8]Bulettes were covered head to toe in armor. Around the head and rear, this armor was a blue-brown color, while in-between the hue might range from gray-blue to blue-green. Areas around the eyes were slightly darkened, with the eyes themselves being a yellow color with blue-green pupils.[8]A bulette in mid-pounce.While bulettes could see in perfect darkness with their eyes, they were not a bulette's primary method of sensory perception. Instead, bulettes typically hunted through the detection of vibrations in the ground, moving towards the source of the movement when their hunger is aroused.[8]They burrowed through soft earth, listening for potential prey and then erupting from the ground to consume their living targets. As they had a distinctive fin that cut through the ground as it approached, these creatures were often referred to as \"land-sharks.\"[citation needed]In many cases, a bulette would swallow its prey whole, also consuming their victim's clothing, weapons, and other equipment, which the bulette could in fact digest successfully through the use of powerful stomach acid.[8]A depiction of a bulette attacking its prey.The male bulette's mating ritual was fairly complicated, involving the killing of deer and boars, which were placed in a wide circle. He then dug a shallow pit in the middle of the circle, and lined it with the bones of the animals he had killed. Over the course of about a week, the bulette slowly grinded the bones in the pit into a fine powder. He then dug underneath the pit and waited for the female.[11]The female usually came along within a month after being attracted by the odor, at which point the bulettes mated. It took only a day and a half for the female to lay around a dozen eggs, covered in spines, and by the next morning, they had hatched. During hatching, the female bulette made a noise like an elephant. Once hatched, the newborn bulettes immediately attacked the mother, in an attempt to kill her. She fought back, and although she usually killed a few of the young, leaving only around a fourth of the young, she succumbed to their attacks more often than not.[11]For the 48 hours immediately after the hatching of the eggs, the powder in the mating pit was saturated with fluid from the eggs, making it a very effective fertilizer.[11]The babies that survived after the battle with their mother then searched for food, and would take the next few days to grow. After two days, the young would reach full size and adulthood in every way, although a bulette couldn't breed until it was at least twenty five years old.[citation needed]Bulettes never took kindly to any other creature's presence, making them impossible to tame in the wild, as they would typically attack anything that came near. The only way for a bulette to be domesticated would be to bond with it over the two days of growth while it was young, and there were a few cases where this was done successfully.[citation needed]Bulettes lived in the Starwood area of the forest of Cormanthor.[11] They were also known to inhabit the mysterious Darkmoon temple along the Sword Coast, where they were studied by the ancient elf, Alain.[12]Bulettes were known to hunt in the Lizard Marsh on the Showrd Coast, north of Daggerford.[13]",

        "description": "Camels were easily recognizable for the hump or humps upon their backs.[3][4] Their fur could be white, pale tan, or deep brown.[5]Camels had very broad feet that allowed them to step onto sand or gravel without sinking as deeply in. This granted them the ability to travel more readily over such terrain than other pack animals.[4]A typical camel could carry a load up to nearly half a ton (450 kg) and drag well over two tons (1,800 kg).[3][4]These animals were very hardy, and could survive for weeks without food or water.[5]Camels were often called the \"ships of the desert\".[5] They played a significant role in trade throughout Zakhara[5][8] and in some parts of Calimshan.[9][10]War camels were favored by the Mulhorandi god Anhur,[11] and some rangers or druids chose camels as their animal companions.[12]Camels had a nasty temper and often spit in the face of an abuser. Camels were shy animals, often preferring to flee than fight.[5]They also required good handling.[5]They could carry heavy loads for long periods of time. Heavily loaded camels often refused to stand up once they were loaded.[5]Domesticated camels would bite, while camels trained for war would primarily kick with their hooves.[3][4]Camel breeding in Zakhara was a well respected profession. Camels were the main transport throughout these lands,and demand for quality breeding was very high. Female camels could give birth once a year.[5][8]Camels ate cereal, shrubs, and grass.[5]A camel being led by a cloaked figure through the city street.Desert camels, or dromedaries, were one-humped camels.[3][4] They were bred for long legs and big humps. Because of this, they were perfect for traveling across the harsh deserts. These slow but persistent animals were always ready to carry a huge load, making them ideal for merchants and travelers alike.[5]Mountain camels had two humps and were shorter and slower but were adapted for rocky, hilly, or mountainous terrain.[3][4] They made poor desert mounts.[5]These camels were dromedaries specially trained for war. They bit the enemy and could inflict damage with their hooves. They could carry a mounted fighter into combat.[3][4] Battle camels were selected from the most powerful livestock and trained for several years. Typically, these camels were stronger and much more courageous than their desert counterparts.[5]Racing camels were trained for speed and not for travel. Because they were not bred for temperament, they were sometimes very aggressive and even spat in the presence of their owner. They had small hooves and long legs, allowing them to run faster than normal camels.[5]",

They stood around 7\u202ffeet (2.1\u202fmeters) tall and weighed approximately 2,100\u202fpounds (950\u202fkilograms).[3]Centaurs were a strong and proud race. Although they typically strove to find peace and balance with nature, they could act with violence when the need arose. Despite this desire for balance, centaurs had to eat a lot to fuel their large bodies and were known to overindulge, especially with wine and ale. A drunken centaur was much more prone to aggressive and violent behavior.[8]Although some were solitary, centaurs generally lived in tribal hunter-gatherer societies. Those that felt a sense of wanderlust to explore the world made excellent companions, and occasionally would offer a ride to allies. The suggestion that they be used as a pack animal however was met with derision.[8]Skerrit the Forester, who dwelt in the House of Nature, was properly the god of the centaurs,[3][9] yet he was not worshiped by many centaurs actually living in Faer\u00fbn. Centaurs of Faer\u00fbn did not pay great heed to the gods at all, and those who did usually worshiped Silvanus, not Skerrit, or they chose one of the elven nature gods.[10] While centaurs of the Realms were not very religious, the elven deities Corellon Larethian, Erevan Ilesere, Rillifane Rallathil, and Solonor Thelandira often called on centaurs to serve as agents for their purposes.[11]They had good relations with elves, being as they were both creatures of the forest. They generally despised humans and dwarves but weren't actively hostile toward them and tolerated gnomes and halflings.[3] It was said that centaurs had a superstitious fear of dragons and giants.[8]In the 1200s DR, a plague affected the numerous centaurs in the Cormanthor forest, causing their left hind leg to become three inches (7.5 cm) shorter than the others, and, as a result, they could not easily escape from predators such as dragons. The elves and halflings of the forest refused to help, fearing that the dragons would turn on them too.[citation needed]A centaur wearing a necklace and feathered earring, while carrying a sword in its scabbard, a quiver, and a bow.Populations dwindled so only three tribes of centaurs remained in the forest, each containing around one dozen families, and they were nomadic (within the forest boundary). Their migrations followed the same route each year, spending the winter in the east Starwood. In the early spring, they moved west, around Myth Drannor, and south to the Semberholme area, where they spent the summer near Lake Sember. At the end of the summer they traveled east, stopping for the autumn in the central Starwood, before repeating the cycle.[citation needed]Although the centaurs followed the same trails they had created over the years, these could be difficult for others to follow because they were disguised with a hallucinatory terrain spell created by the centaur leaders' magical amulets. These amulets were donated by an unknown friendly human priest.[citation needed]The centaurs of the Cormanthor forest were not as friendly toward other creatures as their counterparts elsewhere. They used falcons as scouts to warn them of nearby creatures, and were likely to attack on sight with their bows. They were still respectful of their surroundings, and would protect the forest and its wildlife. They were known to enjoy pears and peaches in particular.[citation needed]Small bands of centaurs lived freely in both the open plains and within the forests of Evermeet. They would hunt, fish and frolic with complete peace of mind. These centaurs worshiped the Sylvan deity Skerrit and were considered by the elves to be \"children of Corellon\".[12]By 1489 DR, tribes of centaurs made their home in the High Forest, in the plateaus around the Unicorn Run. At this point, the tribes had grown so much in size and population that their tribes threatened to split and move to claim new territories.[13]As of 1368 DR, centaurs inhabited the Chondalwood.[14] Some time after 1485 DR, centaurs inhabited the Far Forest, where they were protective of their territory.[15]",

        "description": "Kytons were 6\u202fft (1.8\u202fm) tall humanoids that wore chains as opposed to regular apparel. The chains wrapped tightly around the kytons like a shroud, rattling as they moved and slithering around their bodies as if they were alive.[3] The areas where a kyton's eyes, ears, nose and hair would be were also wrapped in chains, with the only visible areas being their throats, grinning mouths and the occasional glimpse of a single, glinting eye.[4]The spiked shackles were covered in barbs and iron scraps that had been welded on, with each length ending in a hook, blade or weighty ball.[3][4] Their normal weight combined with that of their chains made kytons weigh about 300\u2009lbs (140\u2009kg).[3] It was often difficult to tell a kyton from a regular human draped in chains, although they were frequently mistaken for undead as they matched the traditional idea of a shackled spirit.[3][4]Sadistic and cruel, chain devils gained great pleasure from inflicting pain.[1] Their love of torture made them easy to work with for any entity willing to let them indulge in their brutality.[2] Kytons savored the terror of their prey so greatly that they carefully deciphered the best way to inspire dread in their victims through an enigmatic methodology.[4] Whether through a foreboding direct chase, fleeting between the shadows or stalking their prey for hours, kytons hunted with whatever method induced the most terror in their targets with barely contained glee.[3][4]Chain devils animated the chains on their body and swung them around to rend and restrain their targets. While kytons normally could move only their own chains, a ritual known as the Gift of Chains, allowed them to manipulate chains not attached to their bodies. Up to four chains near the kyton would be animated, causing them to rattle, dance, extend by 15\u202ffeet (4.6\u202fmeters) or gain jagged spikes. The chains also increased a kyton's mobility, letting them freely move and climb along the metal ropes.[4]Chains within the possession of others could be mentally restrained to prevent the kyton from taking control, and if more than one kyton tried to control the same chain, it would not move until one kyton established dominance.[1][4] Animated chains could restrict and lash out at opponents on their own, but could still be broken and would revert to normal after sustaining enough damage or if the chain devil that created them was incapacitated.[1]Kytons also had the ability to assume the faces of deceased individuals known by those that saw them, whether they be loved ones or hated foes. Although all one could see was the lower half of their faces, it was often enough for the victim to recreate the intended visage.[4] Through this unnerving ability, chain devils temporarily caused their prey to run in terror or stand still in shock.[1][4]Kytons constantly regenerated from any injury, never bleeding and regenerating lost limbs when not simply reattaching them. They could not be harmed by the cold nor weakly enchanted weapons.[4] Only weapons made of silver or those with stronger enchantments could harm them, but blessed weapons were capable of slowing their regenerative abilities.[3][4]After chain devils had finished stalking their foes they attempted to capture them alive in order to continue torturing them later.[4] When seriously fighting, they danced around the battlefield wildly swinging their weapons and nimbly dodging any attacks made against them.[2] They only used the Gift of Chains if sorely pressed, or if they believed doing so would strike terror in their targets. When met with blessed weapons, kytons immediately retreated.[4]Kytons were the wardens and tormentors of Baator, called upon to torture the souls of mortals damned to the Nine Hells.[1] Kytons and other devils specialized in pain formed teams of relentless torturers that eviscerated the souls of mortals until both their hope and magical energy was completely drained.[5] The main rivals of the kytons were the excruciarchs, another type of torturer devil. Both types bitterly schemed to undermine each other and excruciarchs were noticeably hated within the main city of the kytons.[6][7]The city known as Jangling Hiter laid within Minauros and was the primary dwelling place of the chain devils.[6] As its police, kytons enforced the city's edicts while tracking and punishing criminals.[4] From within their giant processing stations they mutilated souls with practiced precision, and were so famous for their work that the archdevils outsourced most of their soul-torture to them. Tumbrels of victims went both in and out of the city either for processing or shipping to their new masters, with Asmodeus and Levistus in particular calling on their services.[6] In terms of industry, transport was second to torture, although chain devils were also highly skilled in metalworking.[3]In the City of Chains, all chain devils were equals, never quarreling over standing but rather over the first pick of hapless souls. Short fights occasionally broke out with the victor claiming the soon-to-be victim and the loser retreating into the depths of the city. The only treasure possessed by a kyton were collected from their victims and so their personal belongings were dependent on their abilities and choice of targets.[4]Devils specialized in torture extracted not only pain but secrets, imprisoning their enemies and learning how to corrupt them through rigorous dissection. Those that became true experts in pain while retaining an original style could reach the level of harvester devils.[8] Although red abishai could become chain devils, most opted to stay in the service of Tiamat.[9]Whether it was flesh, spirit, or anguish itself, the true diet of a kyton was a mystery. This was because captured kytons could will themselves to die, causing their bodies to melt away leaving only grease-covered chains and a puddle of foul ichor.[4]Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

        "description": "A chimera had the hindquarters of a goat, the forequarters of a lion, and a set of dragon wings. Additionally, a chimera had three heads, that of a horned goat, a lion, and a dragon.[3][2] This head typically resembled a red dragon, though it was not unlikely to find ones with heads resembling other species of chromatic dragon.[2]All chimeras had access to an array of various abilities. Each of the heads was capable of a unique attack, but the most dangerous by far was the dragon breath of the chimera's draconic head. The exact attack varied from one individual to another, as in dragons, with the type varying based on color. For instance, a chimera with a white dragon head would cast a breath of cold air, while one with a red dragon head would bellow forth scorching flames.[9]A group of adventurers battling a chimera.Chimeras were not very intelligent creatures.[2] Their dragon-like natures often led them to attack intelligent beings for their treasure and to live solitary existences in caves, though some took after the lion and lived in prides.[5]A chimera did not usually perceive humans as a threat, but would normally attack the easiest source of food, and would leave humans alone if an easier source was available. They would not hesitate to withdraw from combat if they became injured, and would not seek vengeance later. A chimera preferred to attack by swooping from the sky, attacking with its claws and its jaws, but they would also charge along the ground, leading with their lion head. Once entered into combat, they would use their dragon head to defend against attackers while their lion head will attempt to grasp its victim's neck in their jaws and snap it. It was not wholly uncommon for the goat head to sleep throughout the entire battle.[10]Other than variants based around which type of dragon a chimera imitated, there were other species of chimera to consider:In addition to those species, chimerae were known to crossbreed, generating bizarre hybrids:Other hybrids may have been possible, such as with ankhegs, though none had been reported as of the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR.[15]Chimeras were typically seen in groups of two or three.[2]Mating usually occurred annually in late spring, with the females being extremely reluctant to perform the act, and even attempting to hide. They typically struggled against the more powerful males, breathing fire from the dragon head. The pregnancy would last around a year, with the average birth consisting of six offspring, which she would abandon after only a few days.[10] The excess milk produced by the female chimera after abandoning its offspring would be released while she slept. It was a thick, black liquid, which acted as an intoxicant for orcs and could be highly prized.[10]Chimeras were an omnivorous species. They primarily ate meat and would resort to a herbivorous diet whenever prey became scarce or non-existent.[5]Due to the draconish part of their nature,[5] chimeras often made their lairs within caves.[2][5] They often decorated these with the bones and belongings of their prey.[2] Their hoards tended to consist primarily of copper and silver coins, with the occasional bits of jewelry and magical items.[5]Chimeras were very adaptable creatures, able to thrive in most climates.[2] Though they were most often found in hilly regions with a temperate climate.[3]Chimeras were capable of understanding both Common and Draconic[2][3] though they could not speak them.[1]Some intelligent creatures were known to train chimeras, using them as pets, guardians, or even mounts. They were sometimes found to be in the company of azers and hill giants.[2]Some misguided sages claimed that chimeras were created by Demogorgon, the two-headed demon lord.[16]",

        "description": "Chuuls were large lobster-like aberrations with a hatred for surface-dwelling humanoids. The many tentacles that surrounded their mouths were capable of causing paralysis with a single touch, thus leaving their unfortunate victim at the mercy of the chuul's powerful claws.[2]Chuuls have been described as \"a horrible mix of crustacean, insect, and serpent\", but most closely resembled an 8\u202ffeet (2.4\u202fmeters) tall yellow-green lobster, weighing around 650\u202fpounds (290\u202fkilograms) with four long legs, two large claws, a strong protective exoskeleton, a fan-like tail, and a mass of paralysis-causing tentacles around its mouth.[3][4]Chuuls really only had two, seemingly contradictory, motivations in life: to be left alone and to eat people. However, even if one of these wants was denied the chuul, it would normally automatically get the other; if there was no-one to eat then it was undisturbed, if it was disturbed then there was most likely someone it could eat.[2]Despite their monstrous appearance, chuuls were actually more intelligent than they seemed, often setting traps and ambushes for their prey, although they were still far from civilized; lacking any sort of culture, ability to make tools, or settlements.[3] However, they did share a racial memory, which they possessed from the moment they hatched. This allowed a chuul to clearly recall events experienced by the previous generation of their race, but this became less and less vivid the further back it went. Such memories tended to carry one defining message though: hate and kill the humanoids.[2]Strong physical combatants, chuuls fought by grabbing and piercing their target with their enormous claws. After the unfortunate victim was trapped within the strong grip of a chuul's pincer, it was either simply crushed or brought towards the creature's mouth tentacles, which grasped and exuded a paralytic secretion. Even if the victim was able to resist the paralysis at first, they would eventually succumb[3], if not to the paralysis itself then to the creature's mandibles. A chuul would normally try to always have one claw free during combat, so that it could deal with any other opponents that might try to interfere. If facing a large number of foes, it would drop a paralyzed or dead victim before moving onto the next attacker.[4]Amphibious by nature, chuuls were actually not great swimmers.[4]Much like a number of other aberrant creatures, chuuls had psychic abilities. However, it was unusual for a young chuul to have access to such powers, instead they would gradually become able to exude psychic static as they aged. Older and larger creatures were able to emit a psychic moan that weakened resistance to psychic attacks and use a psychic lure to draw victims towards it.[2]Chuuls were also able to see perfectly well in the dark, could fight even if blinded, were very alert, and had an innate immunity to poisons.[2][4]A chuul attacking an adventurer with an OtyughChuuls preferred to engage in combat either on land (where they could survive indefinitely) or very shallow water. A chuul would wait by a shoreline, while submerged or partially submerged in murky water, until it heard a suitable prey-item either within or without the water that it could perform a surprise attack upon.[4]Chuuls could be found living as solitary creatures, in pairs,[4] or in small groups of 3-5, which were known as pods.[2] A pod would purposely seek out a body of still water that was large enough to support the entire group. Some chuul, particularly older ones, would create lairs by digging up lake bottoms and building rudimentary structures from trees and stones.[2] A chuul lair consisted of roughly circular rooms that were interconnected by tunnels made just large enough for the biggest member of the resident pod to squeeze through.[2]One of the aforementioned rooms in a chuul lair would always be a trophy room, as chuuls were born hoarders. After making a humanoid kill, a chuul would keep aside something from the victim as a trophy, whether shiny armor, a piece of jewelry, or even a well-crafted saddle. If the victim was not carrying anything of interest, then the chuul would settle for displaying their skull in their trophy room. The skull itself would be empty, but not due to chuul consumption, as they would not eat the brain.[2]Due to desire for solitude, only a small subset of creatures were able to coexist peacefully with chuuls, as intruding on their terrain was extremely dangerous. Given their innate hostility to humanoids, chuuls would attack any such beings whenever they were able. However, this prejudice only extended to surface-dwelling intelligent humanoids such as dwarves, elves, humans, and halflings.[2]The exception to this rule was that chuuls would not prey upon other aberrants or subterranean creatures. In fact, chuuls had been known to work together with grimlocks, troglodytes, and mind flayers, if it allowed them to destroy and consume surface-dwellers. If they didn't discard the brains of their victims far away from their lairs they traded it with the brain-eating mind flayers. A chuul could even be persuaded to barter with the items in their hoard, but only for captive humanoids or other things a chuul considered a \"delicacy\".[2]Surface-dwelling chuul were able to speak Common, while those that made their lairs underground tended to speak Undercommon.[2][4]A swamp-dwelling chuul.Chuul could be found in aquatic lairs in a variety of watery habitats. Although they preferred swamps, jungle lakes, temperate marshes, and underground bodies of water, some individuals would purposely seek out sewer tunnels or coastline shipwrecks in order to provide themselves with a more accessible source of food. They were also known to use rivers, and even oceans, in order to travel to new locales.[2]Oviparous creatures, adult chuul produced clusters of slimy yellow-green eggs from which chuul hatchlings emerged. An adult chuul would lay such egg sacs only rarely, and so would viciously protect them (as would any fellow pod members). If a chuul with hatchlings found itself in a food-poor environment, it would attempt to collect humanoid prisoners to feed to its young. Seemingly counterintuitively to their aforementioned protective care towards their young, chuuls were known to attach their egg sacs to the underside of ships, boats, and rafts in an attempt to increase their distribution to new lands.[2]Brains were poisonous to chuuls.[2]An uchuulon or \"slime chuul\".Chuuls tended to be rather prone to mutations, with magical experimentation, planar rifts, and polluted water affecting and altering them far more easily than other creatures, leading to gigantic and/or poisonous individuals. However, it was only under the experimentation of aberrant magic-users that such mutations reached truly terrifying proportions. Such tinkering was done with the aim of fully unlocking the chuuls' psychic potential and thus create formidable minions that were not only physically powerful, but possessed potent mental powers as well.[2]Older specimens that were able to reach a great size were known as chuul juggernauts.[2] An uchuulon (also known as a \"slime chuul\") was a chuul implanted with a mind flayer tadpole.",

However, these sounds could not penetrate dense materials, such as stone.[4]Their minds and thoughts were so alien that it was said no one could communicate with them.[6]Some cloakers were known to be capable of manipulating the shadows around them, though a light spell would easily render them blind and incapable of using this ability.[4][3][2] Others expressed the ability to conjure up to three illusory duplicates of themselves that copied their movements, but could only do so in an area of darkness.[1][4]Cloakers generally either waited in ambush for their prey,[3] or stalked them from a safe distance.[1][2] Once an opportune moment presented itself the cloaker would unfurl its fins and attempt to engulf their prey within them. Once a cloaker had entrapped its prey in this manner, they would use their long whip-like tail to defend itself from any creatures that might try to intervene.[1][3]A well-fed cloaker on a steady diet of adventurers.Cloakers were generally reclusive creatures, though older ones were known to coerce small groups of humans, goblins, and drow into doing their bidding; however, derro and quaggoths were the most commonly seen servants of older cloakers. At times cloakers were even known to be worshiped by tribes as a sort of god.[2] On occasion, one or more cloaker lords would draw together a population of cloakers to form a city,[6] and despite their generally reclusive nature, cloaker communities were surprisingly social, with the creatures forming odd social cliques, castes, and roles for themselves. They appeared to greatly care about popularity, with the most popular cloakers being those which were larger, had darker coloration, or kept the most \"pets\" in the form of enslaved darkmantles, lurkers, or humanoids.[9]Cloakers did not venerate any deity.[10]Some believed that cloakers were related to creatures known as trappers. Scholars also believed that they may have been an asexual species, but there was no definitive proof of this[4] and cloakers had been observed to appear to court others of their kind within cloaker settlements.[9] It was known, however, that a cloaker lord was capable of spawning cloakers as a byproduct of their own asexual reproduction.[11]Cloakers\u2014or at least their ancestors\u2014were believed to have originated in the Plane of Shadow.[12] In Faer\u00fbn, many were known to inhabit the Underdark, either alone or in settlements like Cloakerhaven[9] or Rringlor Noroth,[13] though scholars believed that cloakers may have once built and inhabited the ruined Underdark city of Ikemmu.[14]Other cloakers were known to inhabit the Shadow Swamp, acting as warlords over lesser creatures in the plane of shadow such as the ghirrash and khumat.[15][16] Beyond that plane, they could be found in the Domains of Dread.[17]",

Their hair was silvery white or brass, and their eyes were iridescent blue.[3][4][6]They often dressed in clothing made of the finest material and jewelry.[3][4][6] Rather than wearing any form of armor, they preferred to wear or carry things enchanted with protective magic.[4] When they did wear armor, it was usually a chain shirt.[3]The wall-mounted mask collection of a cloud giant noble.Cloud giant nobility seldom showed their faces, instead owning and wearing a collection of exquisite masks that were made of precious metals and adorned with gemstones \u2014 the act of wearing a mask was meant to emulate ancient depictions of their patron god Memnor. These masks reflected the noble's current mood, thus masks were prized for how accurate they could express a mood and an individual might shift between many in a single day. Only the richest of nobles could afford the dozens necessary to show all of the possible, subtle differences in emotions.[10]Cloud giants were easygoing people,[11] highly creative, masters at strategizing, and had great appreciation for music.[3][4] They considered life to be a series of obstacles, which were meant to be met with joy rather than sorrow and overcome with applications of skill.[12]Cloud giants commonly had superiority complexes, considering other creatures to be their \"lessers\",[12] which at times blinded them to the consequences of their actions.[13] They also had an obsession for gambling and wagering,[10][14] with a strong desire for high risks and high rewards. Frequently betting on the outcomes of events outside of their control.[14]Cloud giants had vision that extended into the infrared, (although this was not infravision,) which allowed them to see particularly well through fog and cloud,[15] as well as low-light vision.[3] They also had an excellent sense of smell.[15][14]They were wholly immune to lycanthropy of any form.[16]Out of all the giant races, cloud giants were the most outwardly magical. Possessing an innate ability for casting spells related to the air, gravity, and weather.[17] Being able to summon forth a cloud of fog and mist at will[3][14] or turn themselves into mist. Some had even greater control of the weather, being able to bring forth storms and steer the wind just as well as any storm giant.[14]Cloud giants were known to innately have a high affinity for both runecasting and traditional sorcery.[18]Clerics of a good-aligned generally had access to any two of the following domains \u2014 Good, Healing, Strength, or Sun. While evil-aligned clerics had access to any two of the following domains \u2014 Death, Evil, or Trickery.[3]As they were often skilled in strategizing, cloud giants often fought with other creatures in well-organized units under a carefully developed plan of attack. A typical tactic among them was encircling an enemy and barraging them with rocks to distract from the spellcasters among them.[4]When it came to close quarters combat, they were known to favor the use of greatclubs[19] and morningstars that were appropriately sized for their use.[1][3][4][20]The cloud giant race began with an individual by the name of Nicias, one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea, who in the kingdom of Ostoria was ceded control of the skies by Annam.[21] He went on to become one of the first runecasters[22] and won the first cloud palace in a wager with the deity Stronmaus. Cloud giant runecasters went on to study the palace, uncovering the secret of its operation, and soon it became common for them to live in such structures,[23] with them going so far as to construct immense floating cities.[24][25]Cloud giants came to act as the strong right hands of the storm giants in Ostoria,[24] helping them to devise the battle strategies that were utilized by fire giants.[26] During this time they also frequently used crystals, prisms, and mists to paint images upon the ground from fractured sunlight.[25]At some point a civil war occurred, after which a group of cloud giants split off and became an offshoot race known as fog giants.[27]Later on, the Thousand Year War between the giants and dragons kicked off with a flight of red dragons, led by an avatar of Garyx, burning and razing a cloud giant city. Following this, many cloud giant cities transformed into what could be considered fortresses.[25]Following the fall of Ostoria, a great deal of knowledge was lost that included the means by which to construct cloud palaces. Over time the number of cloud giants who lived in them decreased,[14][28] until only those who were at the apex of their ordning claimed them as homes. Some believed the knowledge of creating them was not truly lost forever, but buried within some ancient structure and rumors of a ruined library containing them would crop up from time to time. Many came to believe that this ancient knowledge was bound to be rediscovered someday by a hero.[28]Due to their easygoing nature, cloud giants often spent their time frolicking or celebrating just about everything.[11]The central unit of cloud giant life was family units, rather than the standard giant clan. Consisting of a mated pair, their offspring (if any),[28] and a couple of close relatives.[29] The members of a family usually shared the same sort of alignment.[14]In times of need, scattered cloud giant families would band together as a unified clan.[14][29] These were typically led by older individuals who possessed great talent in spellcasting. Every clan,[4] family, and individual cloud giant knew where their nearest neighbors were, even if it was hundreds of miles away.[29] Clans would sometimes join up with one another to engage in trade, throw celebrations, or battle against other threats.[3][4] Though they preferred not to gather together in too great a number at any one place, knowing their combined treasure hordes would attract adventurers and would-be thieves.[29]Because of their appreciation for music, the majority of cloud giants were known to be capable of playing one or more instrument. Harps were one of the most favored instruments among them.[3][4] The possessions they carried were usually well-made and well maintained. Unlike other giants, they never carried treasures within the shoulder sacks that were typically carried by giants.[3]For cloud giants an individual's place in the Ordning was determined by extravagance and wealth.[14][29] Though possession of greater wealth didn't mean much unless it was on display, either by decoration of their home or themselves.[29] Because of this, appearance was considered reflective of one's station in life, so the more clothing and jewelry one owned the more prestigious they were thought to be.[4] Though there was also emphasis on these extravagances being beautiful or wondrous.[14]Cloud giants also displayed their wealth by the giving of lavish gifts to other families. They believed the best gifts were those that everyone could be convinced was more valuable than its actual worth, with only the giver and receiver ever knowing the truth.[10]One's wealth and place in the ordning could also be shifted by acts of gambling,[14][10] which served them as a sort of bloodless feud that could go on for generations between families.[10] Individuals were even willing to wager their own ordning rank.[14][13] In earlier ages this gambling could involve simple games, such as quist and wah-ree, but over time it became common to bet on the outcomes of events outside of their control. These were referred to by the cloud giants as \"contests\" and thought to measure a cloud giant's ability to master the psychology of other creatures.[12] If one tried to fix the outcome of such wagers by interfering, they were considered the loser if the deceit was discovered.[14]Some cloud giant contests actively involved the act of manipulating lesser creatures, such as wagering one could make a woman fall in love with a select man or that they could make a king abdicate their throne. In such wagers a cloud giant would use anything at their disposal to win, such as magic and messengers. The only rule for such contests that the creatures being manipulated could not catch on to what was going on.[12] If they did, the wagerer lost.[13]Their ordning also featured a complex etiquette revolving around the ideas of victory and loss, which dated back to the days of Nicias. Skilled winners were expected to know how to share their victories with all, while losers were expected to be gracious and humble. Because of this etiquette, loss was considered to be nothing more than the absence of victory.[12] Though they could still be sore losers, resulting in those generations spanning betting wars in which individuals hope to win back what their predecessors lost.[10]Many cloud giants were known to hunt for wild game, such as elk,[30] but in general they were avid gardeners, growing gigantic versions of produce. Such as beans the size of turnips, turnips[29] and apples the size of pumpkins, grapes the size of apples, and pumpkins the size of wagons[14] or carriages.[29]They preferred their food to be carefully prepared with a variety of spices and sauces. Cloud Giants were also known to have a fondness for finely aged wine.[4]Most cloud giants lived atop high mountains,[14][3][28] inside or even above a near-perpetual cloud layer.[3][28] Due to their ordning a cloud giant's home was often extravagant throughout, sporting such things as windows[29] framed in gold leaf or tapestries composed entirely of pearls.[10] All cloud giant strongholds had a space devoted to a garden. These were seldom ever affected by drought, frost, or locusts.[29]Cloud palaces often had complex scrying devices to keep an eye upon the inhabitants of the region they lived in.[12]Cloud giants spoke the general giant language Jotun, their own specialized version of it known as Jotunskye, as well as common.[31] They were often illiterate, though to a lesser degree than giant races whose cultures put little value on education, such as hill and fire giants.[32]Common given names among cloud giants included the following:[33]As a whole, cloud giants were not a very religious people.[34] They generally worshiped either Stronmaus,[35] Iallanis,[36] or Memnor, the latter of whom was considered their patron among the giant pantheon.[24]It was believed that those with evil tendencies typically worshiped Memnor,[37] but in actuality the cloud giants tolerated conflicting ideas about him.[34] Good-aligned cloud giants revered him for his charm, intelligence, and persuasiveness. While those of an evil-alignment revered his trickery. Those who worshiped Memnor generally tried to emulate the aspects of him that they admired.[10] Thus the latter were often deceitful and self-interested.[14] Those who sought to emulate this trickery above all else were known as smiling ones and wore two-faced masks \u2014 one smirking and one frowning, the latter meant to represent displeasure over their place in the ordning \u2014 that served as symbols of their devotion.[34]Among the giant races the cloud giants ranked third in the Ordning,[38] yet they considered themselves to be above all the other giants,[4][14] including storm giants due to their reclusive nature.[14] Though when alongside a storm giant, they considered themselves to be equals.[3][4] When it came to the lesser giant races, cloud giants often employed them to seek out wealth and art on their behalf. Hiring fire giants to act as smiths and crafters, frost giants to act as raiders and plunderers, and hill giants to act as general brutes and combat fodder. Sometimes having those of the hill variety fight each other for their amusement. They might even order the latter two to steal from nearby human lands.[14]Clouds giants often demanded tribute from humans and demihuman communities. They viewed tribute as only proper, for they drove many threats from the areas in which they lived and they were so kind as to not simply take what they wanted,[29] though those of a more evil-alignment were liable to simply raid such communities.[3][4]Many cloud giant families would offer their bountiful produce to such communities when they became stricken with drought, frost, or locusts. Such help was at the root of tales of magic beans and cottages carved from gourds.[29] Good-aligned cloud giants were even known to engage in trade with humanoid communities for clothing, food, jewelry, and wine. Some communities established such good relations with nearby cloud giants that they would come to their aid if endangered.[3][4]Some cloud giants acted as servants of the goddess Aerdrie Faenya.[39]Most cloud giant homes featured one or more pets. The most popular choices among them were creatures of the sky,[29] such as griffons, giant eagles,[4][29] hippogriffs,[4][20] perytons,[14] rocs,[40] owls, and wyverns.[29] Wyverns were more common among the evil-aligned members of this race, who were also known to keep both human and demihuman slaves.[4] Cloud giants were also known to keep creatures other than those that flew, with rare creatures treated as more of a status symbol than companions.[29] Some ground dwelling creatures they were known to keep included owlbears, lions,[14] spotted lions,[19][20] and dire lions.[3]True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

Typically, flocks of them would attempt to overwhelm or confuse their opponents, and flew at their faces.[3]These creatures could be found almost any region,[4] though they typically inhabited temperate or tropical regions, either underground or above ground[5] in plains.[3]Beyond the Prime Material plane, scattered numbers of cockatrices could be found in the Elemental Plane of Earth.[7]Some creatures were known to harvest the venom of cockatrices. Following the Spellplague, this venom typically fetched a price of 100 gold pieces.[8]",

They had large scales, sharp fangs that curved inwards and strong muscles. Large constrictor snakes could reach lengths of up to 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm).[4][7]Constrictor snakes were ambush predators. They either dropped onto a target from above or slowly approached their prey while they were sleeping. They bit into their prey with their sharp fangs, anchoring them while they used their powerful muscles to constrict their prey, causing slow suffocation.[4][7]Some constrictor snakes possessed an innate magical ability to charm a target, causing temporary paralyzation.[4]Constrictor snakes were obligate carnivores.[4] A constrictor snake was large enough to kill and consume a small to medium-sized humanoid. Their jaws have evolved to allow them to eat large prey. The jaw became unhinged from their skull, and the lower jaw had a special elastic ligament which allowed it to spread into two halves.[7]Constrictor snakes were found in warm forests and jungles. They were known to live within Cormanthor[12] and the jungles of Chult.[13]The skin of a constrictor snake was a sought after item in many markets. A good quality skin could cost a buyer up to 100 gp.[4] Scaled Ones were known to mix the blood of constrictors with the venom of vipers to concoct the restorative hooloond oil.[14]",

        "description": "Copper dragons had short faces, with features that included cheek ridges that pointed backwards, as well as frills on the back of their lower jaws. Their long segmented horns started as smooth brow plates above their eyes that extended backwards. From their chins, layers of triangular blades grew downward, growing more numerous as they aged. Combined together, those features gave copper dragons a pensive look. As they aged, their pupils faded away until their eyes acquired an appearance of glowing turquoise.[1][7]Their wings were manta-like, mottled with red and green discolorations near the end. They were supported at the front by relatively short articulated alar limbs that gave them a characteristic U shape when viewed from below, as well as spines that ran the wings' length to the back, at an angle from the backbone.[7]Newly hatched copper dragons had brown scales with a metallic tint, which grew coppery and glossy in color as the dragon aged. The scales of very old copper dragons acquired a green shade.[1][7]Copper dragons gave off a stony scent.[7]When it came to open battle, copper dragons were formidable fighters.[8]Copper dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of powerful acid, and the second was a cone of gas that slowed anyone within it.[3]A review of copper dragon anatomy.Copper dragons were usually even-tempered and sociable. They were well known for playing pranks and telling jokes and riddles. They enjoyed a good joke, riddle, funny story, or any form of good humor or wit, but became annoyed if someone didn't laugh at a joke that they made or take their pranks well. These habits made them especially fond of bards, and they appreciated their company enough that they were sometimes willing to set aside a temporary separate space for them in their lairs so they might provide entertainment.[1]However, they could also be greedy, envious, and stingy, and particularly dangerous when their treasure hoards were at threat. Nevertheless, good companionship was just as much a treasure to them.[1]A copper dragon's lair was usually found in rocky, dry uplands and hilltops, created inside narrow caverns within them. False walls could be created by the dragon in the lair to hide secret chambers and their most treasured items. Other things that were worthless to the copper dragon were placed away from the main hoard in order to tease treasure-seekers. In their main hoard, copper dragons kept precious ores, artworks, and curios that they had accumulated over their long lifetimes.[1]Copper dragons were often found in the service of the deities Brandobaris, Erevan Ilesere, and Vergadain.[9]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "A couatl resembled a long, feathered serpent with a pair of rainbow-feathered wings that allowed it to fly. They were around 12\u202fft (3.7\u202fm) in length, with a wingspan of 15\u202fft (4.6\u202fm). They weighed around 1,800\u202flb (820\u202fkg).[3]Their powerful minds were capable of great psionic might.[3]Couatls live solitary lives, in pairs, or in flights of 3\u20136 individuals. Their intellect was above that of most humans, and often owned treasure. They typically spoke Common, Draconic, and Celestial.[3]Couatls were known for their beauty, magic, and virtue. Due to their intelligence and devotion to good, they were sometimes worshiped by people who inhabited the same area as them.[3]Spellcasters could summon couatls with the summon monster IX spell.[10]Couatl inhabited warm jungles. They were most common in Maztica.[11] Beyond the Prime Material plane, some couatl could be found in the Elemental Plane of Air.[12]A couatl depicted on Ten tarot card.The origins of the couatl laid with sarrukh clans from the kingdom of Okoth. Those sarrukh, having realized that their empire was failing, fled to the other planes of existence. But for over a millennia they were nomadic, traveling from plane to plane as they never found one they were willing to settle in for more than a generation. This life hardened most of them, gradually leading them to embrace their darker natures.[13]Among those sarrukh there were a few who despaired their kindred's embracing of evil. They chose to break off from their peers and prayed to the deity Jazirian, a fragment of the World Serpent, for aid. He responded by transforming those sarrukh into what became known as the couatl. The rest of the Okothian sarrukh declared war on their transformed former brethren, and despite their superior numbers the couatl held their own. This conflict continued until Jazirian was slain by Merrshaulk, a darker fragment of the World Serpent. This forced the couatl to flee back to Abeir-Toril, where they arrived and settled in the land of Maztica.[13] Though splintered off, some flying east to the land of Chult to confront the yuan-ti their people had created.[14]circa -24000 DR, that splinter group of couatl arrived in Chult and engaged in a centuries long conflict with the yuan-ti for control of the Chultan peninsula, eventually ending with a stalemate that marked the Hazur Mountains as the boundary line between their territories.[15]Those that remained in Maztica were embraced by the deity Qotal[13] as his favored beings and signs.[16] They in turn acknowledged him as their god Jazirian reborn, while those had flew to Chult embraced Ubtao as their patron deity.[14] When Qotal later left the True World, he made a prophecy that a couatl would one day appear and be greeted by his chosen daughter. This would be the first sign of the god's return to his people.[16]Around the \u22123000 DR, the couatl population of Chult experienced a steep decline and sought out others to help them keep the yuan-ti from spreading their influence into the peninsula's western end. In their search they came to find the humans and tabaxi of Katashaka, who they preached to of Ubtao.[15][17] One couatl, named Ecatzin, came to the Tabaxi tribes. They were initially resistant, fearing the feathered serpent to be a minion of wrathful god Akongo, but some gradually came to accept Ecatzin's words and learned a little of his language. And a chosen few were even taught a forbidden magic called matumbe, which one tabaxi named Oyai, used to slay the the monster that had been terrorizing them for millennia.[17] Eventually in -2809 DR, the couatl led those tabaxi tribes, alongside the human tribes Eshowe and Thinguth, and many others across the seas to Chult in a grand migration.[15][17]A couatl acting as the patron for a temple.",

        "description": "Giant crabs were known to sport varying arrays of colors. Most commonly reds, browns, and greys. Their bodies were typically covered by a large, chitinous shell.[2] Some species had their eyes atop stalks, allowing them to peak over ledges or around corners.[3]Giant crabs were amphibious creatures, equally capable of surviving on both land and in water.[1][2][3]Giant crabs typically mated in autumn, with males attempting to mate with as many females as they could. The fertilized females were known to bury their eggs in the sand of beaches, which would then hatch the following spring.[2]Giant crabs typically preferred to sneak up on their prey, then catch and dismember them with their large pincers.[2]Some time following its destruction on the Night of Burning Flowers in 647 DR, the castle of Ito-jo in Kozakura was haunted by the ghosts of giant crabs and these hauntings would continue well into the 14th century DR.[5]Around the 14th century DR, one could purchase a leg or whole body of a giant crab to dine upon at Sharkey's Bar & Grill near Ravens Bluff.[6]In the 15th century DR, coven of sea hags dwelling in the Sargauth Level of Undermountain used giant crabs as their mounts and pets.[7]Giant crabs typically made their homes along shorelines, with some burrowing into the sand at day and only coming out to feed around dusk and dawn. Though they were also known to hunt during the morning and night.[2]Giant crabs were known to often feed upon large dead fish and other forms of carrion that sank beneath the waves or washed up on shores. Their tendency to feast upon large carrion along the seafloor was considered an important ecological niche. They were also known to venture into the water in search of fish.[2]In northwest Faer\u00fbn, giant crabs could be found in the Stump Bog.[8]In the Zakhara region's Crowded Sea, they could be found on the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan. Particularly in its bay Batihat al-Saji and the islands of Jazayir al-Alfar and Uyun al-Sartan. Those that inhabited the last island were known as \"the children of Sartan.\"[9]Though difficult to train, some aquatic rangers were known to have them as animal companions.[10]On the surface, giant crabs were often hunted by humans and demihumans for their meat and hard chitinous shells. The latter of which were prized by some as a material for constructing armor and shields.[2]The militia of the Haifami was one such group that wielded shields, fancifully-decorated, that were carved from the shells of giant crabs.[11]",

        "description": "Being reptiles, crocodiles were quite vulnerable to cold, becoming slow and sluggish if exposed to it.[4]Their four legs, though short, were noted as being quite powerful in terms of propelling them rapidly through their watery habitats.[4]Crocodiles mated once every year, laying clutches of up to 60 eggs that they then buried beneath sand. Unlike some reptiles, a female crocodile was known to carefully guard her clutch of eggs against any potential predators. When the eggs eventually hatched the mother would assist her young in getting free of the sand, but thereafter would leave them to fend for themselves. As a result, typically very few hatchlings would manage to survive to maturity.[4]A crocodile attack.Crocodiles typically preferred to ambush their enemies, sneaking up on them and using their powerful jaws to drag people below the water. While some would try to dismember their prey once below the waters, often times crocodiles attempted to drag prey back to their lairs before feasting upon them.[4] When attacking in a group, crocodiles would take turns tearing off chunks of their prey's flesh.[8]They were also known to lash out with their long tails, using them to disrupt an opponent's balance.[4]In 1357 DR, crocodiles could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep.[9]There were rumors that somehow crocodiles had made their way into the sewers of cities in tropical regions and were living off the urban environments' various waste and carrion.[4]Crocodiles rarely had any natural predators, with the exception of humans, who either hunted them for their thick hides to fashion into leather or to simply protect their waterside communities.[4]They were often encountered in the rivers of Chult.[12]In the land of Malatra, there was a large population of crocodiles in Sleepy Lake.[13] In the Crowded Sea region, they could be found on the island of Djinni's Claws.[14]Ragarran priests were often aided by both mundane and giant crocodiles.[15]In Malatra, the Zantira tribe of Nubari were known to hunt the crocodiles of Sleepy Lake with knives. Male members of the tribe often fashioned necklaces made from their teeth.[13]",

Sammaster possessed great power, in a manner similar to Elminster and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun.[3] In Sammaster's case however, the additional power brought delusions of godhood and madness, and he came to believe in time that \"dead dragons shall rule the world entirely\" and began to work toward that goal, fighting the several Chosen of Mystra and even the god Lathander along the way. While Sammaster has died, risen as a lich,[4] and fallen again, his cult lived on, and continued to threaten the Western Heartlands.\nThe Cult of the Dragon venerated dragons, evil dragons in particular, and specifically dead evil dragons. They reanimated the gargantuan corpses as powerful and fell dracoliches. The Cult acted as an information network for its draconian \"masters\", brought gems and riches as offerings, and encouraged evil dragons to become dracoliches. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer\u00fbn and beyond. They could become inhabited by objects which were created in their image especially with the image of the skull.[5]\nContents\nActivities\nOrganization\nCells\nMarsember\nMourktar\nMurgh\u00f4m\nNeverwinter\nSembia\nSunset Mountains\nTymanther\nWyrmsmoke\nHierarchy\nTitles\nEquipment, spells and artifacts\nArmor\nMagical items\nArtifacts\nSpells\nHistory\nAppendix\nAppearances\nFurther Reading\nReferences\nActivities\nThe Cult of the Dragon's main activities were to gather intelligence for the evil dragons of Faer\u00fbn, contribute treasure for their hoards, and aid them in any way possible, in an attempt to gain the cooperation of these dragons.[6] They were also able to make preparations for these evil dragons to transform into dracoliches, and guard dragon lairs, sometimes containing dragon eggs or hatchlings, while these dragons went to hunt or raid.[7]\nIn exchange, the members of the Cult of the Dragon would seek permission to use the dragons' lairs for shelter, and ask for help from the dragons if they were ever called upon using the rings of dragons.[7]\nThe Cult was active throughout the Realms, but was especially powerful in the Cold Lands and the North, where dragons were particularly abundant.[citation needed] Cult member activities included gathering information on particularly rich caravans to be raided, stealing unique items to be offered to their masters, and leading raids against their enemies (who, in their minds, were all those who might oppose the rulership of the dragons).[6] Senior members of the Cult of the Dragon were given the secret of creation of dracoliches and each was also in possession of a ring of dragons. The keepers used these to protect themselves against assailants.[citation needed]\nThe cult was not against legitimate commercial activities, and as such it had several merchant members who used their well earned money to fund cult projects.[8]\nOrganization\nCells\nMarsember\nThe Cult of the Dragon had a following in the Shou enclave of Xiousing in Marsember in the late 15th century DR. The Shou traditionally venerated dragons and the cult found they could operate more openly among the Shou than among other cultures.[9]\nMourktar\nOne of the longest-operating cells of the Cult (f.1005 DR), this group acted as pioneers in the field of magical research related to dragons and undeath. They achieved great success in persuading the dragon Alasklerbanbastos to undergo the transformation to dragonlichdom, and the Great Bone Wyrm has since become the cell's leader. In fact the cell relocated their base of operations from Chessenta to his lair in Mount Thulbane.[10]\nThis cell has had a dogmatic reputation within the Cult of the Dragon as a whole, due to their devotion to Bane, strong ties to his church and emphasis on the teachings of Algashon Nathaire over those of Sammaster. The cell has however, remained united in its hatred of Tchazzar and his followers over the years and saw his return to ascension as an open threat of to Alasklerbanbastos.[10] During the late 14th century, The Great Bone Wyrm hinted at an alliance forming between their cell and the Church of Tiamat, which along with failed attempts at installing draconic leaders in Chessenta and Threskel, had its members weary and marginalized from other Cult branches.[10]\nMurgh\u00f4m\nIn the late 15th century DR the cult operated openly in the dragon dominated realm of Murgh\u00f4m. The cult owned a building in the city of Skalnaedyr known as Dragon House and maintained a fortress on the edge of the Plains of Purple Dust known as the Tower of the Talon.[11]\nCult of the Dragon graffiti in Neverwinter.\nNeverwinter\nIn 1479 DR, a cell of the cult, led by Adimond Kroskas, worked in conjunction with Thayan agents of Valindra Shadowmantle in Neverwinter Wood, searching for a way to restore the dragon Lorragauth to unlife.[12] At the time, someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the southern Blacklake District of Neverwinter with Iokharic writing (the language unrecognized) and the Cult of the Dragon symbol. Locals believed the images were evil, but mistook it for a devil-worshiping cult.[13]\nSembia\nAs of 1368 DR, the commander of the guard in Daerlun, Sembia, was in control of the city through manipulation of the elderly merchant and official ruler Halath Tymmyr. The organization used Daerlun as an arms store and to heal wounded members, preferring to keep activities low-key.[14]\nBy he 1370's DR the senior leaders of the Sembian cell were the Wearers of Purple Salvarad, Zannaster, Zilvreen and Faerlaur Onthim along with seven or so well-to-do merchants and a senior member of the Silver Ravens. The cell was strongly allied with the dracoliches Aurgloroasa and Dretchroyaster, and maintained a loose associated with a few others. The Sembians maintained a strong influence over the Dragonwell cell.[15]\nThe Sembian cell was in a constant resource war with the Zhentarim and repeatedly came into conflict with the church of Tiamat during their efforts to convert the dragons of the Thunder Peaks to undeath. They even became a check on the growing threat of the Shadovar.[15]\nSunset Mountains\nThis Cult cell was housed in a citadel in the Sunset Mountains, near the Well of Dragons, the legendary site that served as a graveyard to dragons in Faer\u00fbn for ages. Their influence stretched from the Serpent Hills in the south to the southern border of the Anauroch, and even off the coast to the island of Evereska.[15]\nIn the late 14th century the Dragonwell cell was led by Naergoth Bladelord, a former member of the Sembian cell. In fact the group in the Sunset mountains maintained close relations with their sister cell, and was full of its expatriated members. They had one allied dragon, Arsekaslyx, who served as their guardian for over a century.[15]\nAs of the late 15th century DR some old dragons continued to make pilgrimages to the site to achieve immortality through dracolichdom.[11]\nTymanther\nIn the late 15th century DR a secret cell of the cult operated in Djerad Thymar, the capital of Tymanther. The cult maintained its membership and beliefs secret, but had a public face called the Abeir Academy that welcomed dragonborn who have had hard times and were looking for a new start, as a way to cultivate potential new members.[16]\nWyrmsmoke\nLocated in the Galena Mountains, the Cult cell that operated from Wyrmsmoke Keep extended their influence over the dragons of Thar and the eastern Moonsea. They often sought out dragons to disrupt the trade lines of the Zhentarim, though they could not sustain open opposition. The Wyrmsmoke cell had lost all their dracoliches, and many of their draconic allies in 1373 DR, largely at the hands of the Talons of Justice.[15]\nThis cell was led by a council of six Wearers of Purple mostly from the Moonsea region; Kaela Ulsant, Crenshyl Khodoil, Delphaeryn Leiyraghon, Orinskar of Thar, Theldar Hammerfist and Dalgar. Their garrison of forces included three tribes of dragonkin, a tribe of draconic orcs and their fire drake mounts.[15]\nHierarchy\nThe structure of a Cult of the Dragon call was comprised of two distinct tiers of cult members, the higher-echelon Keepers of the Secret Hoard, and the more common Followers of the Scaly Way. Each cell was led by one or more members of the Wearers of Purple, whose members commonly overlapped with the Keepers.[17]\nKeepers of the Secret Hoard: The true believers within the Cult. This group was comprised of wizards, most commonly necromancers, a handful of priests and clerics and the most ruthless and vicious of the Cult warriors.[17] Only the Cult mages had the arcane knowledge required to take active duty in providing dragons with beneficial magical items as well as prepare the esoteric potions and rituals needed for a dragon to become a dracolich. As divine spellcasters members were somewhat rare, the mages also often controlled the lesser undead and supported the cell's leadership.[18]\nFollowers of the Scaly Way: In addition, the Cult employed many mercenaries and warriors to act as martial security,[19] and outside agents such as merchants to act as spies, smugglers or move their illicit goods or adventuring companies, while unbeknownst to them,[18] rid the world of problems that hamper Cult activities.[20]\nDoomkin: The elite warriors of the Cult of the Dragon, armed with doomkin scarabs allowing them to dominate their targets who answered only to the Wearers of Purple.[21]\nTitles\nBy the 15th century DR the organization and structure of the Cult of the Dragon had changed somewhat. As of this time titles within the cult included, in descending order:[22]\nWyrmspeaker, the cult's highest echelon that held one office for every primary color of chromatic dragon,[22] Dragonsoul, Dragonfang, Dragonwing, Dragonclaw, and Initiate, entrants into the cult that would train for months or years to attain higher rank.[22]\nEquipment, spells and artifacts\nA cult ritual.\nArmor\nEvil dragon armor[23]\nMagical items\nAmulet of draconic might[24]\nDragon's tooth[24]\nDragon masks\nRing of dragons[25]\nArtifacts\nMask of the Dragon Queen\nTome of the Dragon\nSpells\nMain article: Cult of the Dragon spells\nThe Cult of the Dragon employed a number of unique and specialized spells that were inscribed within the Tome of the Dragon.

The Cult of the Dragon, also known as Keepers of the Secret Hoard or, as of around 1370 DR, Wearers of Purple,[2] was a semi-religious evil organization venerating undead dragons, or dracoliches, founded by Sammaster, a powerful wizard. Sammaster possessed great power, in a manner similar to Elminster and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun.[3] In Sammaster's case however, the additional power brought delusions of godhood and madness, and he came to believe in time that \"dead dragons shall rule the world entirely\" and began to work toward that goal, fighting the several Chosen of Mystra and even the god Lathander along the way. While Sammaster has died, risen as a lich,[4] and fallen again, his cult lived on, and continued to threaten the Western Heartlands. The Cult of the Dragon venerated dragons, evil dragons in particular, and specifically dead evil dragons. They reanimated the gargantuan corpses as powerful and fell dracoliches. The Cult acted as an information network for its draconian \"masters\", brought gems and riches as offerings, and encouraged evil dragons to become dracoliches. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer\u00fbn and beyond. They could become inhabited by objects which were created in their image especially with the image of the skull.[5] The Cult of the Dragon's main activities were to gather intelligence for the evil dragons of Faer\u00fbn, contribute treasure for their hoards, and aid them in any way possible, in an attempt to gain the cooperation of these dragons.[6] They were also able to make preparations for these evil dragons to transform into dracoliches, and guard dragon lairs, sometimes containing dragon eggs or hatchlings, while these dragons went to hunt or raid.[7] In exchange, the members of the Cult of the Dragon would seek permission to use the dragons' lairs for shelter, and ask for help from the dragons if they were ever called upon using the rings of dragons.[7] The Cult was active throughout the Realms, but was especially powerful in the Cold Lands and the North, where dragons were particularly abundant.[citation needed] Cult member activities included gathering information on particularly rich caravans to be raided, stealing unique items to be offered to their masters, and leading raids against their enemies (who, in their minds, were all those who might oppose the rulership of the dragons).[6] Senior members of the Cult of the Dragon were given the secret of creation of dracoliches and each was also in possession of a ring of dragons. The keepers used these to protect themselves against assailants.[citation needed] The cult was not against legitimate commercial activities, and as such it had several merchant members who used their well earned money to fund cult projects.[8] The Cult of the Dragon had a following in the Shou enclave of Xiousing in Marsember in the late 15th century DR. The Shou traditionally venerated dragons and the cult found they could operate more openly among the Shou than among other cultures.[9] One of the longest-operating cells of the Cult (f.1005 DR), this group acted as pioneers in the field of magical research related to dragons and undeath. They achieved great success in persuading the dragon Alasklerbanbastos to undergo the transformation to dragonlichdom, and the Great Bone Wyrm has since become the cell's leader. In fact the cell relocated their base of operations from Chessenta to his lair in Mount Thulbane.[10] This cell has had a dogmatic reputation within the Cult of the Dragon as a whole, due to their devotion to Bane, strong ties to his church and emphasis on the teachings of Algashon Nathaire over those of Sammaster. The cell has however, remained united in its hatred of Tchazzar and his followers over the years and saw his return to ascension as an open threat of to Alasklerbanbastos.[10] During the late 14th century, The Great Bone Wyrm hinted at an alliance forming between their cell and the Church of Tiamat, which along with failed attempts at installing draconic leaders in Chessenta and Threskel, had its members weary and marginalized from other Cult branches.[10] In the late 15th century DR the cult operated openly in the dragon dominated realm of Murgh\u00f4m. The cult owned a building in the city of Skalnaedyr known as Dragon House and maintained a fortress on the edge of the Plains of Purple Dust known as the Tower of the Talon.[11] Cult of the Dragon graffiti in Neverwinter. In 1479 DR, a cell of the cult, led by Adimond Kroskas, worked in conjunction with Thayan agents of Valindra Shadowmantle in Neverwinter Wood, searching for a way to restore the dragon Lorragauth to unlife.[12] At the time, someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the southern Blacklake District of Neverwinter with Iokharic writing (the language unrecognized) and the Cult of the Dragon symbol. Locals believed the images were evil, but mistook it for a devil-worshiping cult.[13] As of 1368 DR, the commander of the guard in Daerlun, Sembia, was in control of the city through manipulation of the elderly merchant and official ruler Halath Tymmyr. The organization used Daerlun as an arms store and to heal wounded members, preferring to keep activities low-key.[14] By he 1370's DR the senior leaders of the Sembian cell were the Wearers of Purple Salvarad, Zannaster, Zilvreen and Faerlaur Onthim along with seven or so well-to-do merchants and a senior member of the Silver Ravens. The cell was strongly allied with the dracoliches Aurgloroasa and Dretchroyaster, and maintained a loose associated with a few others. The Sembians maintained a strong influence over the Dragonwell cell.[15] The Sembian cell was in a constant resource war with the Zhentarim and repeatedly came into conflict with the church of Tiamat during their efforts to convert the dragons of the Thunder Peaks to undeath. They even became a check on the growing threat of the Shadovar.[15] This Cult cell was housed in a citadel in the Sunset Mountains, near the Well of Dragons, the legendary site that served as a graveyard to dragons in Faer\u00fbn for ages. Their influence stretched from the Serpent Hills in the south to the southern border of the Anauroch, and even off the coast to the island of Evereska.[15] In the late 14th century the Dragonwell cell was led by Naergoth Bladelord, a former member of the Sembian cell. In fact the group in the Sunset mountains maintained close relations with their sister cell, and was full of its expatriated members. They had one allied dragon, Arsekaslyx, who served as their guardian for over a century.[15] As of the late 15th century DR some old dragons continued to make pilgrimages to the site to achieve immortality through dracolichdom.[11] In the late 15th century DR a secret cell of the cult operated in Djerad Thymar, the capital of Tymanther. The cult maintained its membership and beliefs secret, but had a public face called the Abeir Academy that welcomed dragonborn who have had hard times and were looking for a new start, as a way to cultivate potential new members.[16] Located in the Galena Mountains, the Cult cell that operated from Wyrmsmoke Keep extended their influence over the dragons of Thar and the eastern Moonsea. They often sought out dragons to disrupt the trade lines of the Zhentarim, though they could not sustain open opposition. The Wyrmsmoke cell had lost all their dracoliches, and many of their draconic allies in 1373 DR, largely at the hands of the Talons of Justice.[15] This cell was led by a council of six Wearers of Purple mostly from the Moonsea region; Kaela Ulsant, Crenshyl Khodoil, Delphaeryn Leiyraghon, Orinskar of Thar, Theldar Hammerfist and Dalgar. Their garrison of forces included three tribes of dragonkin, a tribe of draconic orcs and their fire drake mounts.[15] The structure of a Cult of the Dragon call was comprised of two distinct tiers of cult members, the higher-echelon Keepers of the Secret Hoard, and the more common Followers of the Scaly Way. Each cell was led by one or more members of the Wearers of Purple, whose members commonly overlapped with the Keepers.[17] By the 15th century DR the organization and structure of the Cult of the Dragon had changed somewhat. As of this time titles within the cult included, in descending order:[22] Wyrmspeaker, the cult's highest echelon that held one office for every primary color of chromatic dragon,[22] Dragonsoul, Dragonfang, Dragonwing, Dragonclaw, and Initiate, entrants into the cult that would train for months or years to attain higher rank.[22] A cult ritual. Main article: Cult of the Dragon spells The Cult of the Dragon employed a number of unique and specialized spells that were inscribed within the Tome of the Dragon. As copies of Sammaster's opus were disseminated to leaders of the Cult's cells, they were often used by their arcane members while in service to the Sacred Ones. Many of the more uncommon and rare spells associated with the Cult were based in the metamagic and necromancy schools of magic.

Sammaster possessed great power, in a manner similar to Elminster and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun.[3] In Sammaster's case however, the additional power brought delusions of godhood and madness, and he came to believe in time that \"dead dragons shall rule the world entirely\" and began to work toward that goal, fighting the several Chosen of Mystra and even the god Lathander along the way. While Sammaster has died, risen as a lich,[4] and fallen again, his cult lived on, and continued to threaten the Western Heartlands.\nThe Cult of the Dragon venerated dragons, evil dragons in particular, and specifically dead evil dragons. They reanimated the gargantuan corpses as powerful and fell dracoliches. The Cult acted as an information network for its draconian \"masters\", brought gems and riches as offerings, and encouraged evil dragons to become dracoliches. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer\u00fbn and beyond. They could become inhabited by objects which were created in their image especially with the image of the skull.[5]\nContents\nActivities\nOrganization\nCells\nMarsember\nMourktar\nMurgh\u00f4m\nNeverwinter\nSembia\nSunset Mountains\nTymanther\nWyrmsmoke\nHierarchy\nTitles\nEquipment, spells and artifacts\nArmor\nMagical items\nArtifacts\nSpells\nHistory\nAppendix\nAppearances\nFurther Reading\nReferences\nActivities\nThe Cult of the Dragon's main activities were to gather intelligence for the evil dragons of Faer\u00fbn, contribute treasure for their hoards, and aid them in any way possible, in an attempt to gain the cooperation of these dragons.[6] They were also able to make preparations for these evil dragons to transform into dracoliches, and guard dragon lairs, sometimes containing dragon eggs or hatchlings, while these dragons went to hunt or raid.[7]\nIn exchange, the members of the Cult of the Dragon would seek permission to use the dragons' lairs for shelter, and ask for help from the dragons if they were ever called upon using the rings of dragons.[7]\nThe Cult was active throughout the Realms, but was especially powerful in the Cold Lands and the North, where dragons were particularly abundant.[citation needed] Cult member activities included gathering information on particularly rich caravans to be raided, stealing unique items to be offered to their masters, and leading raids against their enemies (who, in their minds, were all those who might oppose the rulership of the dragons).[6] Senior members of the Cult of the Dragon were given the secret of creation of dracoliches and each was also in possession of a ring of dragons. The keepers used these to protect themselves against assailants.[citation needed]\nThe cult was not against legitimate commercial activities, and as such it had several merchant members who used their well earned money to fund cult projects.[8]\nOrganization\nCells\nMarsember\nThe Cult of the Dragon had a following in the Shou enclave of Xiousing in Marsember in the late 15th century DR. The Shou traditionally venerated dragons and the cult found they could operate more openly among the Shou than among other cultures.[9]\nMourktar\nOne of the longest-operating cells of the Cult (f.1005 DR), this group acted as pioneers in the field of magical research related to dragons and undeath. They achieved great success in persuading the dragon Alasklerbanbastos to undergo the transformation to dragonlichdom, and the Great Bone Wyrm has since become the cell's leader. In fact the cell relocated their base of operations from Chessenta to his lair in Mount Thulbane.[10]\nThis cell has had a dogmatic reputation within the Cult of the Dragon as a whole, due to their devotion to Bane, strong ties to his church and emphasis on the teachings of Algashon Nathaire over those of Sammaster. The cell has however, remained united in its hatred of Tchazzar and his followers over the years and saw his return to ascension as an open threat of to Alasklerbanbastos.[10] During the late 14th century, The Great Bone Wyrm hinted at an alliance forming between their cell and the Church of Tiamat, which along with failed attempts at installing draconic leaders in Chessenta and Threskel, had its members weary and marginalized from other Cult branches.[10]\nMurgh\u00f4m\nIn the late 15th century DR the cult operated openly in the dragon dominated realm of Murgh\u00f4m. The cult owned a building in the city of Skalnaedyr known as Dragon House and maintained a fortress on the edge of the Plains of Purple Dust known as the Tower of the Talon.[11]\nCult of the Dragon graffiti in Neverwinter.\nNeverwinter\nIn 1479 DR, a cell of the cult, led by Adimond Kroskas, worked in conjunction with Thayan agents of Valindra Shadowmantle in Neverwinter Wood, searching for a way to restore the dragon Lorragauth to unlife.[12] At the time, someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the southern Blacklake District of Neverwinter with Iokharic writing (the language unrecognized) and the Cult of the Dragon symbol. Locals believed the images were evil, but mistook it for a devil-worshiping cult.[13]\nSembia\nAs of 1368 DR, the commander of the guard in Daerlun, Sembia, was in control of the city through manipulation of the elderly merchant and official ruler Halath Tymmyr. The organization used Daerlun as an arms store and to heal wounded members, preferring to keep activities low-key.[14]\nBy he 1370's DR the senior leaders of the Sembian cell were the Wearers of Purple Salvarad, Zannaster, Zilvreen and Faerlaur Onthim along with seven or so well-to-do merchants and a senior member of the Silver Ravens. The cell was strongly allied with the dracoliches Aurgloroasa and Dretchroyaster, and maintained a loose associated with a few others. The Sembians maintained a strong influence over the Dragonwell cell.[15]\nThe Sembian cell was in a constant resource war with the Zhentarim and repeatedly came into conflict with the church of Tiamat during their efforts to convert the dragons of the Thunder Peaks to undeath. They even became a check on the growing threat of the Shadovar.[15]\nSunset Mountains\nThis Cult cell was housed in a citadel in the Sunset Mountains, near the Well of Dragons, the legendary site that served as a graveyard to dragons in Faer\u00fbn for ages. Their influence stretched from the Serpent Hills in the south to the southern border of the Anauroch, and even off the coast to the island of Evereska.[15]\nIn the late 14th century the Dragonwell cell was led by Naergoth Bladelord, a former member of the Sembian cell. In fact the group in the Sunset mountains maintained close relations with their sister cell, and was full of its expatriated members. They had one allied dragon, Arsekaslyx, who served as their guardian for over a century.[15]\nAs of the late 15th century DR some old dragons continued to make pilgrimages to the site to achieve immortality through dracolichdom.[11]\nTymanther\nIn the late 15th century DR a secret cell of the cult operated in Djerad Thymar, the capital of Tymanther. The cult maintained its membership and beliefs secret, but had a public face called the Abeir Academy that welcomed dragonborn who have had hard times and were looking for a new start, as a way to cultivate potential new members.[16]\nWyrmsmoke\nLocated in the Galena Mountains, the Cult cell that operated from Wyrmsmoke Keep extended their influence over the dragons of Thar and the eastern Moonsea. They often sought out dragons to disrupt the trade lines of the Zhentarim, though they could not sustain open opposition. The Wyrmsmoke cell had lost all their dracoliches, and many of their draconic allies in 1373 DR, largely at the hands of the Talons of Justice.[15]\nThis cell was led by a council of six Wearers of Purple mostly from the Moonsea region; Kaela Ulsant, Crenshyl Khodoil, Delphaeryn Leiyraghon, Orinskar of Thar, Theldar Hammerfist and Dalgar. Their garrison of forces included three tribes of dragonkin, a tribe of draconic orcs and their fire drake mounts.[15]\nHierarchy\nThe structure of a Cult of the Dragon call was comprised of two distinct tiers of cult members, the higher-echelon Keepers of the Secret Hoard, and the more common Followers of the Scaly Way. Each cell was led by one or more members of the Wearers of Purple, whose members commonly overlapped with the Keepers.[17]\nKeepers of the Secret Hoard: The true believers within the Cult. This group was comprised of wizards, most commonly necromancers, a handful of priests and clerics and the most ruthless and vicious of the Cult warriors.[17] Only the Cult mages had the arcane knowledge required to take active duty in providing dragons with beneficial magical items as well as prepare the esoteric potions and rituals needed for a dragon to become a dracolich. As divine spellcasters members were somewhat rare, the mages also often controlled the lesser undead and supported the cell's leadership.[18]\nFollowers of the Scaly Way: In addition, the Cult employed many mercenaries and warriors to act as martial security,[19] and outside agents such as merchants to act as spies, smugglers or move their illicit goods or adventuring companies, while unbeknownst to them,[18] rid the world of problems that hamper Cult activities.[20]\nDoomkin: The elite warriors of the Cult of the Dragon, armed with doomkin scarabs allowing them to dominate their targets who answered only to the Wearers of Purple.[21]\nTitles\nBy the 15th century DR the organization and structure of the Cult of the Dragon had changed somewhat. As of this time titles within the cult included, in descending order:[22]\nWyrmspeaker, the cult's highest echelon that held one office for every primary color of chromatic dragon,[22] Dragonsoul, Dragonfang, Dragonwing, Dragonclaw, and Initiate, entrants into the cult that would train for months or years to attain higher rank.[22]\nEquipment, spells and artifacts\nA cult ritual.\nArmor\nEvil dragon armor[23]\nMagical items\nAmulet of draconic might[24]\nDragon's tooth[24]\nDragon masks\nRing of dragons[25]\nArtifacts\nMask of the Dragon Queen\nTome of the Dragon\nSpells\nMain article: Cult of the Dragon spells\nThe Cult of the Dragon employed a number of unique and specialized spells that were inscribed within the Tome of the Dragon. As copies of Sammaster's opus were disseminated to leaders of the Cult's cells, they were often used by their arcane members while in service to the Sacred Ones. Many of the more uncommon and rare spells associated with the Cult were based in the metamagic and necromancy schools of magic. These subjects were part of Sammaster's obsession after his fall as one of Mystra's Chosen.[26]\nAbsorption[27] \u2022 Algarth's embattlement[27] \u2022 Animate skeletons[28] \u2022 Animate zombies[29] \u2022 Attract ghoul[30] \u2022 Become bones[30] \u2022 Charmthwart[29] \u2022 Combine[31] \u2022 Command undead[28] \u2022 Deathmaster's vial[32] \u2022 Death armor[30] \u2022 Death ward[31] \u2022 Dweomerburst[33] \u2022 Empower skeleton[34] \u2022 Enlarge skeleton[28] \u2022 Fear aura[35] \u2022 Find familiar (necromancer)[36] \u2022 Forcefend[37] \u2022 Ghastly hands[29] \u2022 Gloom[37] \u2022 Mordenkainen's penultimate cogitation[38] \u2022 Persistence[38] \u2022 Pierce any shield[39] \u2022 Pierce magic resistance[35] \u2022 Protection from Deathbane[36] \u2022 Protection from Deathbane, 10' radius[37] \u2022 Putrefaction[29] \u2022 Rary's spell enhancer[32] \u2022 Rary's superior spell enhancer[33] \u2022 Rary's urgent utterance[33] \u2022 Ray of paralysis[29] \u2022 Resist turning[36] \u2022 Sammaster's conjunction[39] \u2022 Sammaster's lash[37] \u2022 Semipermanency[40] \u2022 Shatterbone[38] \u2022 Skeletal guard[41] \u2022 Skeletal spellcraft[35] \u2022 Spectral ears[28] \u2022 Spectral eyes[36] \u2022 Spellcaster[41] \u2022 Spelltouch[32] \u2022 Thrice[33] \u2022 Thrice, improved[38] \u2022 Thrice supreme[41] \u2022 Triad gem \u2022 Undead aides[41] \u2022 Undead lieutenancy[34] \u2022 Undead servant[28] \u2022 Undead summoning I[34] \u2022 Undead summoning II[32] \u2022 Undead summoning III[33] \u2022 Undead summoning IV[38] \u2022 Undead summoning V[40] \u2022 Undead summoning VI[27] \u2022 Undead summoning VII[24] \u2022 Undead touch[34] \u2022 Unlife[27] \u2022 Zone perilous[40]\nHistory\nMain article: History of the Cult of the Dragon\nOriginally, The Cult of the Dragon lacked any formal headquarters or strong leadership, which caused the organisation to be disjointed and often in conflict with itself.[7]\nAlthough Sammaster was killed in 916 DR during an ambush by the Harpers and clergy of Lathander, Algashon Nathaire led the organization underground, and Sammaster gained lichdom, having prepared for the event of his death.[7][42]\nKya Mordrayn's scarred cultists in the ruins of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR.\nBy around 1370 DR, the Cult had spread widely, and its own tenets had diverged, leading to members in different areas having different ideas of the Cult's formation and ultimate destiny.[7]\nAfter Sammaster's destruction in the late 14th century DR, the cult had no true leader, although, as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, it revered Anabraxis The Black Talon as its ultimate authority. The cult was organized into semi-autonomous cells, each led by one or more \"Wearers of Purple\".[8]\nIt was during this leaderless period that a cultist named Severin Silrajin came to prominence.[1] Guided by Tiamat,[43] he decided that the Chronicles of Years to Come had been mistranslated by Sammaster, and predicted that the world would be ruled not by dead dragons, but by living ones. He quickly rose through the cult's ranks until he became its leader, at which point he refocused the cult's efforts to summoning Tiamat into Faer\u00fbn.[1] This plot nearly succeeded, but following its failure, the Cult fractured between those who wished to return to their old mandate to honor undead dragons and those who wished to pursue the new philosophy.[43]\nAppendix\nAppearances\nAdventures\nSteelheart \u2022 Vale of the Dragon Oracle \u2022 Hoard of the Dragon Queen \u2022 Rise of Tiamat\nNovels\nShandril's Saga (Spellfire, Crown of Fire, Hand of Fire) \u2022 The Veiled Dragon \u2022 Temple Hill\nComics\nTyranny of Dragons\nVideo Games\nPool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor \u2022 Neverwinter (Tyranny of Dragons)\nFurther Reading\nCarrie Bebris (2000). \u201cRogues Gallery: The Heroes of Myth Drannor\u201d.

The Cult of the Dragon, also known as Keepers of the Secret Hoard or, as of around 1370 DR, Wearers of Purple,[2] was a semi-religious evil organization venerating undead dragons, or dracoliches, founded by Sammaster, a powerful wizard. Sammaster possessed great power, in a manner similar to Elminster and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun.[3] In Sammaster's case however, the additional power brought delusions of godhood and madness, and he came to believe in time that \"dead dragons shall rule the world entirely\" and began to work toward that goal, fighting the several Chosen of Mystra and even the god Lathander along the way. While Sammaster has died, risen as a lich,[4] and fallen again, his cult lived on, and continued to threaten the Western Heartlands. The Cult of the Dragon venerated dragons, evil dragons in particular, and specifically dead evil dragons. They reanimated the gargantuan corpses as powerful and fell dracoliches. The Cult acted as an information network for its draconian \"masters\", brought gems and riches as offerings, and encouraged evil dragons to become dracoliches. Their belief was that dracoliches were destined to one day rule Faer\u00fbn and beyond. They could become inhabited by objects which were created in their image especially with the image of the skull.[5] The Cult of the Dragon's main activities were to gather intelligence for the evil dragons of Faer\u00fbn, contribute treasure for their hoards, and aid them in any way possible, in an attempt to gain the cooperation of these dragons.[6] They were also able to make preparations for these evil dragons to transform into dracoliches, and guard dragon lairs, sometimes containing dragon eggs or hatchlings, while these dragons went to hunt or raid.[7] In exchange, the members of the Cult of the Dragon would seek permission to use the dragons' lairs for shelter, and ask for help from the dragons if they were ever called upon using the rings of dragons.[7] The Cult was active throughout the Realms, but was especially powerful in the Cold Lands and the North, where dragons were particularly abundant.[citation needed] Cult member activities included gathering information on particularly rich caravans to be raided, stealing unique items to be offered to their masters, and leading raids against their enemies (who, in their minds, were all those who might oppose the rulership of the dragons).[6] Senior members of the Cult of the Dragon were given the secret of creation of dracoliches and each was also in possession of a ring of dragons. The keepers used these to protect themselves against assailants.[citation needed] The cult was not against legitimate commercial activities, and as such it had several merchant members who used their well earned money to fund cult projects.[8] The Cult of the Dragon had a following in the Shou enclave of Xiousing in Marsember in the late 15th century DR. The Shou traditionally venerated dragons and the cult found they could operate more openly among the Shou than among other cultures.[9] One of the longest-operating cells of the Cult (f.1005 DR), this group acted as pioneers in the field of magical research related to dragons and undeath. They achieved great success in persuading the dragon Alasklerbanbastos to undergo the transformation to dragonlichdom, and the Great Bone Wyrm has since become the cell's leader. In fact the cell relocated their base of operations from Chessenta to his lair in Mount Thulbane.[10] This cell has had a dogmatic reputation within the Cult of the Dragon as a whole, due to their devotion to Bane, strong ties to his church and emphasis on the teachings of Algashon Nathaire over those of Sammaster. The cell has however, remained united in its hatred of Tchazzar and his followers over the years and saw his return to ascension as an open threat of to Alasklerbanbastos.[10] During the late 14th century, The Great Bone Wyrm hinted at an alliance forming between their cell and the Church of Tiamat, which along with failed attempts at installing draconic leaders in Chessenta and Threskel, had its members weary and marginalized from other Cult branches.[10] In the late 15th century DR the cult operated openly in the dragon dominated realm of Murgh\u00f4m. The cult owned a building in the city of Skalnaedyr known as Dragon House and maintained a fortress on the edge of the Plains of Purple Dust known as the Tower of the Talon.[11] Cult of the Dragon graffiti in Neverwinter. In 1479 DR, a cell of the cult, led by Adimond Kroskas, worked in conjunction with Thayan agents of Valindra Shadowmantle in Neverwinter Wood, searching for a way to restore the dragon Lorragauth to unlife.[12] At the time, someone regularly graffitied a wall of a dilapidated building in the southern Blacklake District of Neverwinter with Iokharic writing (the language unrecognized) and the Cult of the Dragon symbol. Locals believed the images were evil, but mistook it for a devil-worshiping cult.[13] As of 1368 DR, the commander of the guard in Daerlun, Sembia, was in control of the city through manipulation of the elderly merchant and official ruler Halath Tymmyr. The organization used Daerlun as an arms store and to heal wounded members, preferring to keep activities low-key.[14] By he 1370's DR the senior leaders of the Sembian cell were the Wearers of Purple Salvarad, Zannaster, Zilvreen and Faerlaur Onthim along with seven or so well-to-do merchants and a senior member of the Silver Ravens. The cell was strongly allied with the dracoliches Aurgloroasa and Dretchroyaster, and maintained a loose associated with a few others. The Sembians maintained a strong influence over the Dragonwell cell.[15] The Sembian cell was in a constant resource war with the Zhentarim and repeatedly came into conflict with the church of Tiamat during their efforts to convert the dragons of the Thunder Peaks to undeath. They even became a check on the growing threat of the Shadovar.[15] This Cult cell was housed in a citadel in the Sunset Mountains, near the Well of Dragons, the legendary site that served as a graveyard to dragons in Faer\u00fbn for ages. Their influence stretched from the Serpent Hills in the south to the southern border of the Anauroch, and even off the coast to the island of Evereska.[15] In the late 14th century the Dragonwell cell was led by Naergoth Bladelord, a former member of the Sembian cell. In fact the group in the Sunset mountains maintained close relations with their sister cell, and was full of its expatriated members. They had one allied dragon, Arsekaslyx, who served as their guardian for over a century.[15] As of the late 15th century DR some old dragons continued to make pilgrimages to the site to achieve immortality through dracolichdom.[11] In the late 15th century DR a secret cell of the cult operated in Djerad Thymar, the capital of Tymanther. The cult maintained its membership and beliefs secret, but had a public face called the Abeir Academy that welcomed dragonborn who have had hard times and were looking for a new start, as a way to cultivate potential new members.[16] Located in the Galena Mountains, the Cult cell that operated from Wyrmsmoke Keep extended their influence over the dragons of Thar and the eastern Moonsea. They often sought out dragons to disrupt the trade lines of the Zhentarim, though they could not sustain open opposition. The Wyrmsmoke cell had lost all their dracoliches, and many of their draconic allies in 1373 DR, largely at the hands of the Talons of Justice.[15] This cell was led by a council of six Wearers of Purple mostly from the Moonsea region; Kaela Ulsant, Crenshyl Khodoil, Delphaeryn Leiyraghon, Orinskar of Thar, Theldar Hammerfist and Dalgar. Their garrison of forces included three tribes of dragonkin, a tribe of draconic orcs and their fire drake mounts.[15] The structure of a Cult of the Dragon call was comprised of two distinct tiers of cult members, the higher-echelon Keepers of the Secret Hoard, and the more common Followers of the Scaly Way. Each cell was led by one or more members of the Wearers of Purple, whose members commonly overlapped with the Keepers.[17] By the 15th century DR the organization and structure of the Cult of the Dragon had changed somewhat. As of this time titles within the cult included, in descending order:[22] Wyrmspeaker, the cult's highest echelon that held one office for every primary color of chromatic dragon,[22] Dragonsoul, Dragonfang, Dragonwing, Dragonclaw, and Initiate, entrants into the cult that would train for months or years to attain higher rank.[22] A cult ritual. Main article: Cult of the Dragon spells The Cult of the Dragon employed a number of unique and specialized spells that were inscribed within the Tome of the Dragon. As copies of Sammaster's opus were disseminated to leaders of the Cult's cells, they were often used by their arcane members while in service to the Sacred Ones. Many of the more uncommon and rare spells associated with the Cult were based in the metamagic and necromancy schools of magic. These subjects were part of Sammaster's obsession after his fall as one of Mystra's Chosen.[26] Absorption[27] \u2022 Algarth's embattlement[27] \u2022 Animate skeletons[28] \u2022 Animate zombies[29] \u2022 Attract ghoul[30] \u2022 Become bones[30] \u2022 Charmthwart[29] \u2022 Combine[31] \u2022 Command undead[28] \u2022 Deathmaster's vial[32] \u2022 Death armor[30] \u2022 Death ward[31] \u2022 Dweomerburst[33] \u2022 Empower skeleton[34] \u2022 Enlarge skeleton[28] \u2022 Fear aura[35] \u2022 Find familiar (necromancer)[36] \u2022 Forcefend[37] \u2022 Ghastly hands[29] \u2022 Gloom[37] \u2022 Mordenkainen's penultimate cogitation[38] \u2022 Persistence[38] \u2022 Pierce any shield[39] \u2022 Pierce magic resistance[35] \u2022 Protection from Deathbane[36] \u2022 Protection from Deathbane, 10' radius[37] \u2022 Putrefaction[29] \u2022 Rary's spell enhancer[32] \u2022 Rary's superior spell enhancer[33] \u2022 Rary's urgent utterance[33] \u2022 Ray of paralysis[29] \u2022 Resist turning[36] \u2022 Sammaster's conjunction[39] \u2022 Sammaster's lash[37] \u2022 Semipermanency[40] \u2022 Shatterbone[38] \u2022 Skeletal guard[41] \u2022 Skeletal spellcraft[35] \u2022 Spectral ears[28] \u2022 Spectral eyes[36] \u2022 Spellcaster[41] \u2022 Spelltouch[32] \u2022 Thrice[33] \u2022 Thrice, improved[38] \u2022 Thrice supreme[41] \u2022 Triad gem \u2022 Undead aides[41] \u2022 Undead lieutenancy[34] \u2022 Undead servant[28] \u2022 Undead summoning I[34] \u2022 Undead summoning II[32] \u2022 Undead summoning III[33] \u2022 Undead summoning IV[38] \u2022 Undead summoning V[40] \u2022 Undead summoning VI[27] \u2022 Undead summoning VII[24] \u2022 Undead touch[34] \u2022 Unlife[27] \u2022 Zone perilous[40] Originally, The Cult of the Dragon lacked any formal headquarters or strong leadership, which caused the organisation to be disjointed and often in conflict with itself.[7] Although Sammaster was killed in 916 DR during an ambush by the Harpers and clergy of Lathander, Algashon Nathaire led the organization underground, and Sammaster gained lichdom, having prepared for the event of his death.[7][42] Kya Mordrayn's scarred cultists in the ruins of Myth Drannor circa 1369 DR. By around 1370 DR, the Cult had spread widely, and its own tenets had diverged, leading to members in different areas having different ideas of the Cult's formation and ultimate destiny.[7] After Sammaster's destruction in the late 14th century DR, the cult had no true leader, although, as of the Year of the Ageless One, 1479 DR, it revered Anabraxis The Black Talon as its ultimate authority. The cult was organized into semi-autonomous cells, each led by one or more \"Wearers of Purple\".[8] It was during this leaderless period that a cultist named Severin Silrajin came to prominence.[1] Guided by Tiamat,[43] he decided that the Chronicles of Years to Come had been mistranslated by Sammaster, and predicted that the world would be ruled not by dead dragons, but by living ones. He quickly rose through the cult's ranks until he became its leader, at which point he refocused the cult's efforts to summoning Tiamat into Faer\u00fbn.[1] This plot nearly succeeded, but following its failure, the Cult fractured between those who wished to return to their old mandate to honor undead dragons and those who wished to pursue the new philosophy.[43]",

        "description": "A darkmantle hanging from a cave ceiling by its foot muscle.A darkmantle resembled an octopus or squid with limestone-colored skin and a thick membrane of skin stretched between each of its tentacles,[4][3] reaching about two-thirds of the way to the tips.[4] Part of its body was covered in a stony dorsal shell.[4] When perfectly still, they looked just like stalactites, stalagmites, or other lumps of stone.[4][1][3][5] A darkmantle had eight eyespots, but these were not true eyes.[4]Each of a darkmantle's tentacles was covered in \"teeth\", and it had a lamprey-like mouth at their intersection. From the back of its head was a mucus-covered foot-muscle, with which it could cling to a wall or ceiling.[4]A typical specimen weighed about 30 pounds (ten kilograms) and stretched about four feet (one meter) from the tip of its head to the tip of one of its tentacles.[3] They did not have bones and so pre-adult individuals could squeeze themselves through surprisingly tight spaces.[4]Darkmantles could \"see\" in natural darkness,[2] but not with true vision. Their vestigial eyes could only sense light and dark.[4] They primarily relied upon an echolocation similar to that of bats.[4][1][3] Because their \"blindsight\" had limited range,[4][3] they preferred enclosed spaces and darkness to open spaces or sunlight and very rarely wandered from their subterranean homes.[4]The tips of a darkmantle's tentacles had sense organs similar to taste or smell with which they could locate needed minerals to consume for their shells. They also had superb senses of hearing, by means of tiny pits spaced evenly over their tentacles.[4]A darkmantle could slither much like a snail using its foot, but they could move much more quickly by using their tentacles like legs. This was actually its fastest method of locomotion. Its magical flight could provide lift, but it had to flap the skin between its tentacles for propulsion and was thus a clumsy flier, and its magic only kept it airborne for limited amounts of time. Darkmantles could occasionally catch a small meal in their mouths while flying, but this was rare.[4]To appear like stalactites, darkmantles would hang from their foot and press their eight tentacles tightly together to form a point.[4] They could also cling to a surface with their tentacles, hanging with their pointed heads downwards instead,[5] but their grip with their tentacles was not nearly as good\u2014only their muscular foot was \"sticky\".[4]Darkmantles were about as intelligent as dogs,[2][3] and sometimes they were encountered in packs[2] known as clutches or swarms.[3]Darkmantles were prey for several cave creatures. Their usual defense was to disguise themselves as stone, but they would also alternate ground movement with flight to throw off predators tracking them by scent.[4]Other than the high-pitched sounds used for their natural sonar, darkmantles made no other vocalizations.[4]Darkmantles had the magical power of flight[1][2][3] and the ability to create an aura of unnatural darkness[1][3][5] fifteen[1] to twenty[4] feet (five or six meters) in radius, maintaining such an effect from up to ten minutes[1] or even much longer than that.[4] They could also change their skin color to match their environment.[4][3][5]A darkmantle slashing at a straw dummy with its toothed tentacles.A darkmantle would cling to the ceiling of a cavern and remain still until prey moved below it.[4][1][2][3] At such a point, it would drop suddenly down and unfurl its mantled tentacles in an attempt to engulf the victim's head, all while emitting its magical darkness. If successful, the darkmantle would blind, suffocate, and crush its prey.[4][1][3] If a darkmantle missed, it would fly to the ceiling and try again.[4][3]Darkmantles could also slash with their tentacles, and since the tips were covered with \"teeth\" this could cause more damage than one might expect.[4]Darkmantles resided in the wild in the Upperdark[1][7] and in the Shadowfell.[1][2] In the settlement of Cloakerhaven, they were kept as pets.[8] Shadar-kai also kept them as pets.[2]Left: An anatomical examination of a darkmantle, highlighting its mouth and tentacles. Right: The darkmantle life cycle from egg (top) to adult (bottom).Biologically, a darkmantle was a magical and highly evolved type of mollusk.[4]Darkmantles were hermaphrodites with both male and female reproductive organs. After mating, each of the pair would lay eggs in clutches of six to eight. These eggs were chicken-sized but the color of stone. Darkmantles maintained no sort of relationship with either their mates or their offspring.[4]After a tenday or so, the eggs would hatch, and darkmantles would begin their lives as tiny black grubs, which appeared much like slugs. Darkmantle grubs were about an inch long and had eight eyespots, two in the front and three on each side. Grubs were herbivores, feeding on fungi, mosses, and lichen with toothed tongues called radulae.[4]After about seven days of life, a grub's radula would lengthen and split, and these prototentacles would then lengthen and split a second time. After a third splitting, the creature would have eight tentacles. Once its tentacles accounted for half of its body length, a darkmantle would begin to grow a shell from its back, composed of the minerals consumed during its time as a grub. After several months, the darkmantle would be an adult about two feet in length. They would usually cease growing at about four feet in length. A darkmantle's lifespan was about six years.[4]Beneath its shell, a darkmantle had a statocyst, a special organ used by mollusks for balance. This helped darkmantles keep balance when hanging precariously from a wall or ceiling by their foot.[4]Darkmantles required sleep, and they also hibernated for several months at a time, hanging like stalactites during this time. Unless hibernating, an adult darkmantle could survive for about seven days between feedings. They consumed water from deep subterranean pools.[4]Darkmantle \"eyes\" could substitute for bat fur as a material component for the darkness spell.[4]Some scholars believed that darkmantles were originally from the Shadowfell.[2] Others believe them to have evolved from the piercer,[4][3][5] another mollusk that hung from cave ceilings and disguised itself as stone.[9]",

        "description": "A deep gnome, holding a gemstone.Deep gnomes were wiry and lean with a body as hard as a slab of rock ranging from 3 to 3.5\u202ffeet (0.91 to 1.1\u202fmeters) in height and weighing between 40 to 45\u202fpounds (18 to 20\u202fkilograms). Males were completely bald and beardless, while the females sported hair.[8] Deep gnome complexions were sometimes described as \"gnarled\" and, like drow and duergar, were commonly dark in hue, with most deep gnomes demonstrating brown or gray skin with dark gray eyes. Females typically had gray hair.[11]Deep gnomes were a surly and cynical people who fatalistically expected little more from life than what they had. While they treated their own kind with respect and even goodwill, trust was not easily given to anyone from outside their village, or even outside their family.[8] They kept to themselves, were extremely cautious when contacting other races, and eyed all strangers with suspicion.[11]Sullen and hard-working, deep gnomes were wholly dedicated to any task to which they set themselves, typically mining for males and housekeeping for females. Although outsiders found deep gnomes' overly serious attitude made for sour company, those qualities made the svirfneblin tireless pursuers of excellence in their metalworking and weapon forging. These attitudes were also justified in part by the harsh environs the deep gnomes inhabited, which required a degree of stoicism and quiet suffering in order to serve the greater good. Any sounds or raised voices could attract danger to deep gnome homes and fire was used sparingly for cooking and warmth. Their seriousness and pessimism only faded when admiring the gems which fascinated them so much.[12]Although far more serious than most gnomes, deep gnomes nonetheless exhibited the same insatiable curiosity and craftiness when put in the right circumstances. It was this trait, more than any other, which led some deep gnomes to abandon their cautious upbringing and explore the world around them. Some of these wandering deep gnomes turned upwards and investigated the surface world from which their ancestors came, particularly deep gnome illusionists who hoped to find advanced instruction in the Art beyond what could be obtained in their isolated homes. Others become prospectors, searching the Underdark for new veins of gems and ore to mine.[13]Deep gnome were better adapted for underground living than either rock gnomes or forest gnomes, with darkvision to help them see in total darkness and a dwarf-like affinity for stone, allowing them to innately understand it on a level few other races could appreciate. Conversely, deep gnomes lacked most gnomes' predilection for cantrip-like abilities, but could instead blind other beings, obscure their own presence, or shapeshift. Deep gnomes also had a great deal of resistance to magic of any kind, and could go undetected as if they were using the nondetection spell, alongside their natural affinity for avoiding danger or hiding.[14]The small size of deep gnomes could give them a combat advantage when battling larger opponents.The harsh conditions of life in the Underdark shaped gnome society in a number of unusual ways. Children were an extremely important part of deep gnome society, in part due to a low birthrate relative to the mortality rate. Deep gnome couples usually had fewer than four children and rarely more than six. Deep gnome mothers doted on their children obsessively, but not in such a way that inhibited their growth. When they reach adolescence, children were quickly apprenticed to masters in whatever trade they were expected to take on. Adulthood was less defined among deep gnomes than among their kin, with maturity commonly agreed upon to be the time at which a deep gnome started working full-time in a trade. Most males were miners or lapidaries, while females were the masters of the home, raising children, keeping the house tidy, gathering food, and preparing meals.[13]Deep gnomes considered male and female gender roles equally important. Males were masters outside of the home and females were masters within. This concept of equal labor for either sex carried all the way to the top of svirfneblin society, with each city governed by a king and queen who ruled as equals. The king was often the head of the community's mining operations and defenses, while the queen was tasked with ensuring that the community had enough food and water to survive, while also handling the day in and day out bureaucracy. Significantly, the king and queen were rarely married to each another, but instead came into their positions independently, elected for life upon the death of their predecessor. Regardless of gender, there was no true conception of retirement among deep gnomes, who worked until they could physically work no more.[15]Deep gnome culture was largely defined by the environment in which they lived. Deep gnome settlements were usually centered in a single large cavern, surrounded by an interlocking set of tunnels and other caverns into which the city spread. These settlements were often large villages or small towns, with a population of around a thousand gnomes. Typically cut off from all outside contact, even from other deep gnome settlements, many inhabitants never ventured out of their havens, instead crowding together for protection. Population density was extremely high as most families shared a single, small room for their living space, with children living with their parents until they themselves married and had children.[13]Deep gnomes rarely wandered far beyond their hidden cities, but when they did, it was usually as bold prospectors, youthful illusionists, or exploring warriors. These bold souls shared a deep curiosity that allowed them to overcome their hard-bred caution and shyness, although other motives such as economic drive or a desire to seek aid to fight a threat the deep gnomes could not conquer on their own might also play into their departure.[13][16]Deep gnomes who became adventurers most frequently were fighters, rangers, rogues, or wizards (particularly illusionists). Although well-suited to the arcane arts like other gnomes, they were also fit to becoming rangers or rogues, adapted as they were to hiding and navigating the labyrinthine caverns of the Underdark. Deep gnomes of the martial persuasion who survived their adventures and came back with knowledge and experience sometimes became breachgnomes, elite warriors trained to defend a position against superior numbers.[13][16]As a whole, deep gnomes were a hard-working and joyless people, but even the crustiest deep gnome required time to relax and let off steam. Deep gnomes' intense dedication and ability to survive under harsh conditions often showed up in such activities. Deep gnome architecture, for instance, was shaped largely by the conditions they lived in, with the oldest homes often carved directly out of the surrounding rock. The highest-ranking members of any one clan usually inhabited large stalagmites while the lower-class lodged in the surrounding cavern floors or walls.[13]Deep gnome cuisine was also a reflection of their livelihood, with the common staples made up of a variety of exotic fungi found only in the Underdark. Other common foods included blind fish and occasionally a roast made of roth\u00e9, goat, or mutton. Because fire produced unwanted light and smoke, deep gnomes generally preferred to salt their food instead of cook it, which made most svirfneblin food practically inedible to outsiders. For drink, most deep gnomes drank a salty spirit,[17] fermented fish, which, like svirfneblin food, was an acquired taste. On occasion, deep gnomes might drink a more potent beverage called Gogondy, said to contained powdered ruby and grant powerful visions to those who drank it.[18]Artistically, deep gnomes preferred to use lots of gemstones, which were relatively common in svirfneblin communities, mined out of the veins along which their cities were built. Deep gnomes were some of the best jewelers in the Underdark. Deep gnomes also turned their cultivation of mushrooms for food into a wider industry, developing fungi not only for food but for textiles and wood as well. For their defense, deep gnomes most often designed weapons that could be used as non-violent tools as well, largely favoring the use of light picks, darts, or crossbows. Deep gnomes also used specialized weapons, such as acid darts, caltrops made from crystals, and flash grenades.[5]Deep gnomes summoning an earth elemental.Like other gnomes, deep gnomes preferred the use of illusion to other schools of magic. However, while this was simply a cultural preference among rock gnomes, it was a method of survival for deep gnomes. In addition to knowing the relatively simple invisibility spell, most gnome illusionists were familiar with a great wealth of ancient and forgotten lore recovered from the ruins scattered about the Underdark. Deep gnomes rarely understood this knowledge fully, but that hardly mattered, and they were willing to use it in any way they could. Deep gnome wizards who were not illusionists were frequently diviners, using their spells to locate and find materials essential to survival. Most magic items forged by deep gnomes were disguised as jewelry, which was relatively common among the svirfneblin.[18]Like their surface cousins, deep gnomes worshiped the gnome pantheon. Although deep gnomes were not particularly devout, clerics and other religious figures served an important role in svirfneblin society as guardians of the public morale, keeping spirits up in spite of hardships. Unlike other gnomes, deep gnomes did not feel a particularly strong bond to Garl Glittergold, who some felt had abandoned them for the less serious rock gnomes and forest gnomes.[5]Deep gnomes felt far closer to Segojan Earthcaller compared to their pantheon leader, particularly those who kept pets, were rangers, or who otherwise worked with domesticated animals. Meanwhile, deep gnomes feared Urdlen, whom they believed attacked particularly greedy svirfneblin, luring them with precious jewels. These fears may have reflected, as much any divine intervention, the very real unknown dangers that lurked in the Underdark. Despite their fear, they respected him for reminding them to stay alert.[5]Of all the Lords of the Golden Hills however, deep gnomes felt the strongest ties to Callarduran Smoothhands, the Master of Stone, who they generally saw as their protector and divine benefactor. According to svirfneblin myths it was Callarduran who taught the deep gnomes to summon and befriend earth elementals, and the deep gnomes honored him by using the six-pointed star from his holy symbol into their art. However, it was taboo to use Callarduran's golden ring around the star, as that was the purview of the god himself.[18]Only two holidays were commonly celebrated among the deep gnomes, the rest were created on a whim by local priests. The Festival of the Ruby celebrated the legendary time when Callarduran hid the rubies and other gems of the world in the earth for the deep gnomes to find, and was considered a day where searches were likely to be fruitful. The Festival of the Star honored the Master of Stone as an unwavering protector of the deep gnomes. As part of the festival rites, deep gnomes gathered along the shores of subterranean lakes or pools to watch small, phosphorescent fungi (that they specially bred for this purpose) light up across the cavern ceilings in a panorama similar to that of a night sky reflecting in the water. As much as this was in honor of Callarduran (whose symbol included a star), it was also a reminder of their origins on the surface world and that they were not alone in the dark.[18]A rare example of a deep gnome adventurer (left) and her rock gnome companion (right) fighting a band of kobolds.Deep gnome relations with other races were colored by the impression of most surface-dwelling races that deep gnomes, like the duergar or drow, were a cruel and vindictive relative of their surface cousins. This was untrue, and while often suspicious and sullen, deep gnomes were a largely agreeable people. Those that made the effort to befriend a deep gnome typically found they had a wry outlook on their own nature and were both pragmatic and loyal.[19]Deep gnomes were not particularly eager to correct outsiders of their error and for the most part preferred to be left alone. As a rule, deep gnomes were deeply distrustful of all other races,[8] though they held a special enmity for the drow and the duergar whose violent ways often interfered with the svirfneblin desire for isolation.[5] Deep gnomes were most accepting of gloamings and slyths, since these folks rarely threatened them. They dealt very cautiously with grimlocks and orogs since they were known to plunder weaker races like the deep gnomes.[20]If forced to deal with surface-dwellers, a deep gnome was most likely to find common ground with forest gnomes who were also reclusive and withdrawn. If compelled to seek out companions who were not gnomes, deep gnomes were open if not friendly towards gold dwarves, shield dwarves, and some of the Tel-quessir. Beyond that, deep gnomes had few opinions other than a general distrust.[5] Those that made a living by selling the gems, weapons, and metalwork to outsiders typically met in a neutral cavern with many escape routes in case of treachery.[20]Deep gnomes did not generally keep pets, though a few kept small blind fish in a bowl. However, deep gnomes had no particular aversion to animals and often cultivated herds of roth\u00e9, goats, or sheep on the outskirts of their towns, doing their best to keep the herds quiet and uninteresting to potential attackers. Deep gnomes were known to grow fond of small animals such as moles, shrews, bats, dire rats, or cavvekans, although these could be more accurately called animal acquaintances than actual pets.[5]Deep gnomes did not live quite as long as their kin, with a life expectancy just under two centuries. Due to this and a number of cultural affectations, deep gnome children were considered adults at roughly twenty years of age.[8]Svirfneblin lived in harmony with the rocks they carved and their natural environment. They were skillful artisans who created functional homes without destroying the natural beauty of their habitat.[21] Their skill in mining, gem-cutting, and artificing made their handiwork well sought after by neutral merchants throughout the whole Underdark.[citation needed] They were also excellent guides, scouts and foragers because they knew of underground portals, tunnels, and passages long forgotten by the other races. Having to rely on stealth and cunning, they had truly mastered traveling through their environment, resulting in some of the finest subterranean deep gnome rangers.[citation needed]One of the largest deep gnome cities in Faer\u00fbn was the city of Blingdenstone, until the drow of Menzoberranzan summoned bebeliths inside the city in Year of the Tankard, 1370 DR.[8] A group of almost five hundred survivors fled to the surface and settled within the lands of the North, particularly in Luruar.[7][22]There were at least a dozen deep gnome towns to the east of the Great Rift in south Faer\u00fbn, circa 1370 DR. They were peaceable neighbors to the dwarves of the Deep Realm.[23]Svirfneblin also aided in the mining of bloodstones out of Bloodstone Mine in Damara as they knew where all of the most valuable deposits were to be found. More recently, the svirfneblin of this region opened a college of illusion magic.[citation needed]Most other svirfneblin lived isolated in small communities in the Underdark, hidden away from the drow and other Underdark races who terrorized and subjugated them.[citation needed]Deep gnomes may not have always dwelt so far below the surface world. Many human cities, Calimport for example, were built on top of deserted gnome cities which were repurposed as cellars and sewers. Dolblunde, a gnome city northeast of Waterdeep was also evidence of svirfneblin dwellings near the surface before it was taken over by the dracolich Daurgothoth.[23]Although gnomes in general lacked any kind of cohesive history, deep gnomes brought this cultural idiosyncrasy to its greatest extremes. Deep gnomes lacked not only a tradition of keeping records or writing biographies, but they also never developed a calendar or a method by which to track the passing of time as the drow did. To a deep gnome, the very concept of day or night was foreign, having never seen the light of the sun or the stars of a night sky.[8]In fact, so deep-rooted was this cultural lack of time-keeping, either of the past, present, or future, that among outsiders the history of the deep gnomes amounted to little more than the story of Blingdenstone, the only deep gnome settlement well known among non-svirfneblin. Blingdenstone, founded in the Year of Fragile Beginnings, \u2212690 DR, by clans fleeing the phaerimms beneath Netheril, grew to prominence in large part thanks to its proximity to the infamous drow city of Menzoberranzan and the less infamous but equally strong, duergar fortress of Gracklstugh. In spite of the presence of these two mighty cities, Blingdenstone survived for over two millennia, supported by the rich mining industry that thrived on Blingdenstone's rich veins of arandur and other exotic minerals.[8]However, Blingdenstone, like so many deep gnome cities, came to ruin in the end, albeit in a peculiar way. In the Year of the Wanderer, 1338 DR, the ruler of Blingdenstone, King Schnicktick welcomed into his city Drizzt Do'Urden, a fugitive of Menzoberranzan's harsh justice. Drizzt stayed for only a short while, but his route would later be tracked twenty years later by a vengeful army from Menzoberranzan during their invasion of Mithral Hall in the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR. Realizing the danger to themselves, the deep gnomes abandoned their homes and sought refuge in the darkness. After the drow passed their city, leaving it largely unharmed, a group of deep gnome wardens led by Belwar Dissengulp convinced King Schnicktick to lend his aid to Mithral Hall's defense.[8]The resulting victory at the Battle of Keeper's Dale saved Mithral Hall but it cost the deep gnomes their home. Twelve years later, in Marpenoth of 1370 DR, the matron mothers of Menzoberranzan launched a full-scale assault on Blingdenstone. The deep gnomes' defenses were no match for a drow army aided and supported by demons summoned from the Abyss. Thousands perished in the siege and thousands more were enslaved by the vengeful drow. Those that escaped made their way to Mithral Hall and Silverymoon where they were welcomed, eventually settling throughout the neighboring area.[8]There were tales of a gnome kingdom named Aselkor somewhere under the Endless Ice Sea above the Spine of the World. Speculated to be under the southern edge of the glacier, it was said to be warmed by geothermal energy that allowed the gnomes to create forests of fungi that they turned into furniture as well as food and drink. Rich ruby deposits were said to produce good quality stones, some as big as a fist or larger.[23]",

        "description": "Devas appeared as human-like men and women[note 2] of extraordinary beauty or handsomeness with two magnificent feathered wings emerging from their shoulders.[5][6][4][2][3][1] Monadic and movanic devas stood around 6\u20136.5 feet (1.8\u20131.98 meters) tall, while astral devas were around 7\u20137.5 feet (2.1\u20132.3 meters) tall. Their coloration varied: astral devas were golden-hued with fair hair and amber eyes; monadic devas were dark-skinned with black hair and green eyes; and movanic devas were milky-white-skinned with silvery hair and eyes.[5][6][4][2][3] In the late 15th century DR, devas were known for their silvery skin and their lustrous eyes and hair.[1][note 3]Devas were averse to clothing; when they must adhere to mortal custom, they donned simple loincloths or other coverings.[3]When a deva died, all parts of their body, what clothes they wore, their weapons, and their other possessions vanished completely, and thus none were ever examined closely.[4][3]Devas shared the devotion to goodness of the other angels.[5][6][4][3] No deva would negotiate with beings known to be evil, but those of non-lawful inclination sometimes dealt with neutral beings.[5][6][3] They were strong-willed and fearless.[4][3]There were three varieties or orders of devas: the astral devas, the monadic devas, and the movanic devas.[5][6][4][3] Though the orders differed in might and magical power, they were of equal political status and saw no rivalry between them.[4][3] Nevertheless, the orders might sometimes bicker over differences in personality, but they always cooperated.[3] Devas of no particular order were known in the late 15th century DR.[1]They usually worked alone, but also operated in pairs, trios,[5][6][4][3] or squads of up to six members.[5][6][3]Devas were servants and messengers of the good gods, able to go wherever in the planes they were ordered. However, they often had to be proactive and deliver their messages at the points of their swords, and, indeed, preferred it. Thus, they were also mighty warriors in the battle against evil, wherever in the multiverse it appeared.[5][6][4][3][1] They almost always acted on the orders of the gods, but were often summoned by powerful spellcasters to do good work, via a high-level summon monster, gate, or planar ally spell. Only rarely did they act on their own initiative, but when they did, it invariably involved righteous violence.[3] Though they could travel freely across the Upper Planes, devas generally only did so when acting on the orders of a deity; when not in service, chaotic devas only traveled rarely, and lawful devas not at all.[5][6] Only astral devas were able to travel astrally.[5][6] The devas could operate more-or-less equally well in any environment, even in water.[5][6]Each order of devas had a different role in the grand scheme of the Upper Planes.[4] Astral devas chiefly existed to battle fiends in the Lower Planes. They also traveled to the Astral Plane to rescue lost or stranded mortals of good alignment.[5][6][4] They generally watched over and, where they could, aided good beings and served as patrons for planewalkers and mighty creatures who pursued good causes.[2] Monadic devas existed to watch over the Elemental Planes; they could survive any elemental environment without ill effect.[5][6][4][3] They also oversaw the Ethereal Plane.[5][6][3]The privileged movanic devas traveled to the Prime Material Plane to aid prominent followers of the gods of good in times of great need. While they more often appeared disguised as humanoids or animals, they could manifest in their winged angelic form if this suited their needs.[5][6][4] They were charged with serving the needs of the Prime Material Plane, the Negative Energy Plane, and the Positive Energy Plane, and also fought as infantry against armies of evil.[5][6][3]In the late 15th century DR, devas were sent as agents to the Material Plane, the Feywild, and the Shadowfell.[1]Whatever realm or plane they were sent to, devas used their shapechanging powers to adopt a suitable guise, usually appearing to mortals as an unremarkable animal or humanoid.[1] In particular, when at peace among mortals, movanic devas more often appeared in disguise as humanoids or animals, and rarely in their natural forms.[4][3] However, devas would manifest in their awesome winged angelic forms if it suited their needs.[4][1] There were legends of devas that spent years dwelling among mortals in disguise, helping and inspiring the good people around them.[1]Some devas acted as angelic guides to mortal aasimar, appearing to them in visions and offering wise direction.[8]Within the Great Wheel cosmology, the devas were known to dwell in the Upper Planes, those Outer Planes that were aligned with good, namely Arborea, Arcadia, the Beastlands, Bytopia, Elysium, Mount Celestia, and Ysgard, where a few dwelt.[4][9]An astral deva (front) with a planetar (middle) and a solar (back).The devas served the gods of good as their proxies and served the cause of goodness itself.[5][6][4] They were classed among the \"celestial stewards\", the most mighty and just of angels who directly served the gods of the Upper Planes, and included devas, lights, planetars, and solars.[10] [5][6] They were far from the most powerful entities on the Upper Planes, but their might was not to be disregarded either.[5][6]Devas of all kinds were known to serve the deities Azuth, Ilmater, and Mystra, while movanic devas in particular served Deneir, Lliira, and Milil.[11][12]They served as the common soldiery in the armies of good in the eternal war against evil.[3] They were a fundamental component of the forces of good, forming a reliable and strong vanguard of the Upper Planes, alongside the agathinon. They dwelled and worked in total harmony with the other beings of the Upper Planes, and had a close relationship with other aasimon, especially planetars. On occasion, when the need was great, a planetar would lead a band of devas on a mission for a good deity.[4]Devas possessed all the powers, protections, and traits common to the aasimon[10] or angel,[3] and many more of their own. Like other angels, a deva could envelop themselves with a potent protective aura against evil, similar to protection from evil or magic circle against evil but twice as strong and even combined with a minor globe of invulnerability.[5][6][4][3] They were immune to injury from mundane and minor magical weapons.[5][6][4][3][1]All devas were initially reported to use the spells cure disease and cure serious wounds thrice a day; cure light wounds, detect traps, and dispel magic each seven times a day; heal once a day; and detect evil, detect illusion, detect magic, etherealness, know alignment, invisibility and invisibility, 10' radius, light (varying with the kind of deva), protection from evil (varying with the deva), read magic, remove curse, remove fear, teleport (without error), tongues, and ultravision, as often as they willed. They also had a constant infravision in place.[5][6] Later, this list was given as cure disease thrice a day; cure light wounds, detect snares and pits, and dispel magic each seven times a day; heal once a day; and detect lie, invisibility, 10' radius, light, protection from evil, remove curse, remove fear, and tongues as often as they willed. They also had a constant infravision in place.[4] Later, it was reported they could cast aid, continual flame, detect evil, discern lies, plane shift, remove curse, remove disease, and remove fear.[2][3] After 1487 DR, devas could cast only detect evil and good at will and commune and raise dead once a day, but they also had a healing touch that could undo injury, remove curses, and cure disease, poisoning, blindness, or deafness.[1]Before and after 1358 DR, they were known to be all immune to injury from cold, electricity, gases, natural fire, non-magical weapons, and magic missile. They could not be petrified or poisoned. Astral and movanic devas were resistant to magical fires, while monadic devas were completely immune.[5][6][4] From 1372 DR, like other angels, they were immune to acid, cold, petrification, and had resistance to electricity and fire, and monadic devas were also still immune to fire.[3] In the late 15th century, it was reported they could not be charmed, demoralized, or exhausted and were resistant to spells, magic, and radiance.[1]All orders of deva had the power to change their own form at will, either through the spell polymorph self,[5][6][4][3] the spell polymorph restricted to themselves only,[2] or an inherent ability to change shape.[2][3][13][1] This last let them change form into a small or medium humanoid[3][13] or into an animal.[3][1] If killed, they reverted to their true form.[13][1]When a deva died on the Prime Material plane or the Elemental planes,[5][6] all parts of their body, what clothes they wore, their weapons, and their other possessions vanished completely.[3] Only their material body was destroyed, while their immortal spirit returned to their home plane. It took ten years to regain the power to manifest a corporeal form. If they died on any other plane, then they were destroyed utterly.[5][6]An astral deva.Although they might use many different weapons, each order of deva commonly wielded a specific weapon: a disrupting mace for the astral deva, a smiting mace or rod for the monadic deva, and a flaming two-handed sword for the movanic deva. They had no need of any treasure or wealth,[5][6][4][3] though might still carry useful items.[2]In the late 15th century, any weapon wielded by a deva was radiantly magical. They usually carried very large maces.[1]In 1369 DR, a group of six astral and monadic devas, led by the deva Ariziel, was dispatched to capture the Winged, a dark planetar cast out from Celestia for failing Torm. The devas could not overcome the Winged, and found themselves captured in turn. They were turned into fallen devas and forced to fight in the gladiatorial arena of the Winged's master, the Thayan wizard Dennaton, where they eventually perished.[14]Lumalia, an astral deva servant of Mystra.Devas are named for figures from Indian mythology, having roles as gods of Hinduism, enlightened beings in Buddhism, and heavenly beings in Jainism, and later adopted as nature spirits in New Age belief. The devas of D&D seem to share some traits of all these devas, as well as of the angels of Western tradition and Abrahamic religions, but for the most part it's just a name. Deva is a Sanskrit word translated as \"deity\", \"god\", \"exalted one\", or \"shining one\"; deva is the masculine form, devi is the feminine form.Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

They had thick fur that was mottled grey or black in color, and they had eyes like fire.[3]Dire wolves were far more aggressive than normal wolves,[7] attacking and killing anything they could catch. They can be found singly as lone wolves or in packs numbering five to eight dire wolves.[3]They could generally be found in temperate forest environments,[3] such as the Starwood[10] the Silver Marches,[11] and the Toadsquat Mountains.[12] However some were occasionally encountered in colder environments, such as the North Country of Rashemen[13] or within some caves found throughout Icewind Dale.[14]Dire wolves were occasionally kept by hill giants,[15] members of the Gray Wolf tribe of the Uthgardt people,[16] and Black Blood cultists.[17] A leash and collar made for a dire wolf cost 8 sp from Aurora's Emporium, as of the mid\u201314th century DR.[18]They had keen senses, including a sharp sense of smell, allowing them to track their prey by scent. They could also move stealthily on the hunt.[3]Dire wolves fought in packs, fighting efficiently and surrounding their prey and flanking it to gain an advantage. Their bite was their only weapon, but they could drag a creature to the ground once they had gotten a hold of them.[3]In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Conner and a young boy were traveling on a moor when fog swept in and they were beset by starving dire wolves. However, before the beasts closed in for the kill, a shaft of moonlight transported them to Waterdeep.[20]",

        "description": "Formerly: Elemental Chaos[2]Djinn resembled extremely tall (averaging ten and a half feet in height) human men and women, well-muscled and physically fit. Their features were aristocratic and considered attractive by human standards. Their skin tone ranged from pale blue to a more common olive-brown or dark tan characteristic of Zakharans. Their eyes are usually brown, but a rare few had blue eyes; these were believed to be marked by Fate for great deeds, whether for good or ill, and they could also have increased powers of the evil eye. Djinni garments were typically shimmering silk, designed for comfort and to flaunt their muscular physiques.[9]A beautiful and wild djinni.Djinn were wild but benevolent creatures as a whole.[10][11].While no genie liked being enslaved, djinn were the most tolerant of temporary servitude to mortals. They were forgiving of a mortal master's flaws or even amused by them. They viewed short-term servitude as determined by Fate, and knew that no one could defy one's fate. However, long-term service upset them, and being imprisoned was considered anathema. They would not forgive betrayal. Those who wished to gain the brief service of a djinn should gift them with fine meals, gemstones, magical items, flattery, and other forms of bribery.[9]Djinn could carry up to 600\u202fpounds (270\u202fkilograms) without tiring, and could carry 1,200\u202fpounds (540\u202fkilograms) for a short time. They could travel freely to the elemental planes, as well as to the Prime Material Plane, the Ethereal Plane, and Astral Plane. However, they normally traveled only to the Elemental Plane of Air and the Prime Material.[9]The djinn were ruled by the Great Caliph Husam al-Balil ben Nafhat al-Yugayyim, the Master of the Clouds and the Son of the Breezes. He rarely left his capital, the Court of Ice and Steel.[12] He was served by various nobles and officials, including lesser caliphs, viziers, beys, emirs, sheikhs, sherrifs, and maliks.[13] Each djinni freehold was ruled by a local sheikh or headman.[12]All djinn swore allegiance to the Grand Caliph, whose word was law. For disobeying a local caliph, a djinni risked punishment, but the penalty for disobeying the Grand Caliph was death. While djinni government was fairly loose, it was still too restrictive for most djinn, and they often visited the Prime Material Plane for the sake of respite from local lords and family.[9]While they appeared in great numbers on their home plane, djinn tended to be solitary on the Prime Material Plane. Most djinn were friendly toward mortals, but mischievous. They often played pranks on mortals, such as conjuring illusionary people who claimed to be in need. They normally left high-ranking people alone, for fear they might have ties to the Grand Caliph.[9]Although djinn did not require food or drink to live, they enjoyed rich flavors, smells, and other sensations. They commonly desired succulent fruits, great feasts, pungent wines, fine perfumes, shimmering silks, smooth satins, soft velvets, and other rich fare.[9]Djinn dwelt in the Elemental Plane of Air (or the Elemental Chaos from the viewpoint of the World Axis cosmology[2]), in djinn freeholds, floating islands of earth and stone, which they crammed with courtyards, buildings, gardens, fountains, and sculptures made from flame.[7]The capital of the djinn was the Citadel of Ice and Steel, a chunk of ice and earth sculpted into an aerodynamic oval shape. The citadel was in a perpetual falling state, and no gravity could be imposed within it by any force less potent than the Great Caliph of all djinn.[12]On the Prime Material Plane, djinn favored the open desert to cluttered urban areas. However, being somewhat friendly toward mortals, they visited cities on occasion.[9]A djinni windseer.The djinn, like all genies, are enlightened, which means they belong to the faith founded by a prophetess called the Loregiver long ago. Few are clerics, because the djinn are not, by and large, a pious people. However, they are willing to adopt pretty much any deity into their pantheons and give lip service to many deities, in order that they have an appropriate deity to please for any possible thing they might do.[14]In the djinni capital, the Court of Ice and Steel, there are mosques dedicated to the Amerindian gods Thunder and Wind, the Mulhorandi god Shu, the eagle deity Remnis, the elf goddess Aerdrie Faenya, and the Zakharan deities Haku and Hakiyah.[14]Djinn speak Jannti, the racial language of all genies. Whether Jannti is a single language or four closely related elemental languages is a matter for debate, however.[15] Djinn also speak Midani, the common tongue of Zakhara. They have a limited telepathy that allows them to communicate with any intelligent creatures they meet.[9]The djinn were on good terms with jann and sometimes visited their camps in the high deserts of Toril. They were cool toward the marids, disliking their haughtiness. They openly despised dao and efreet, and only rarely hesitated before attacking them.[9]When the world was young, the gods and genies were at war, and mortals were pathetic creatures trapped between the two warring forces. To these mortals was born a beautiful girl, her smile like the shining moon and her laugh more lovely than a songbird's melody. Her beauty became so renowned that the gods themselves heard of it. First Kor and Hajama and Najm spied her, and each became convinced that she must serve him alone. They began to quarrel among themselves, and the cosmic phenomena stirred by their emotions attracted the attention of the genies. And they too were smitten by her beauty, so the Grand Caliph of the Djinn, the Grand Khan of the Dao, the Most Respected Sultan of the Efreet, and the Imperial Padishah of the Marids began to also quarrel for the hand of the bewitching mortal. The elements themselves responded to their lust and fury, and the mortals feared for their lives. The maiden fled to the southern jungles, and Fate herself was besmitten by the maiden's lovely appearance. When the maiden told Fate how the gods and genies had treated her, though, Fate decided to teach both factions a lesson. She disguised the maiden as a hideous old man and sent her back to the city of mortals, where the elements and heavens were in an uproar as the gods and genies fought. It is said that some of the mortals who fled during this terrible time became the first peoples of Faer\u00fbn and Kara-Tur, while those brave few who remained were the ancestors of all Zakharans, for Zakhara is the center of the world. When the gods and genies spied the maiden disguised as an old man, though, the disguised maiden asked them why they were quarreling. When the terrible entities paused to explain, the old man declared he would judge who among them was the best match for the beautiful maid, and demanded they show her to him. Of course, the maiden could not be found, and because Fate was with her, none could penetrate her disguise. The old man told them she would only appear when they left, so the gods and genies begrudgingly returned to their respective realms, pausing their long war while they waited for a decision. However, the gods chose ten men and ten women to be their representatives; these were the first clerics. The genies, for their parts, agreed to leave but promised to send their servants and warriors back from time to time. When only the old man remained, she removed her disguise. Fate explained that the gods and genie rulers could not return and punish her, because that would mean admitting to being tricked by a mere mortal. Fate remained with her for a long time, teaching her wisdom and how to deal with both genies and gods. Sometimes in her own form, and sometimes disguised as an old man, she inspired great art, mighty spells, and wise philosophy and lore. She recorded her wisdom on a set of scrolls, which would one day be discovered by Zakhara's First Caliph. The maiden would be remembered as the Loregiver, the founder of the Enlightened Faith. She has yet to decide which god or genie she will choose as consort.[16]This tale recounts the origin of the genie-binders known as sha'irs. Born an orphan and raised by his uncle, the boy's jealous uncle schemed to have him slain so that he would never inherit his parents' business, which the uncle had been running while he raised the boy to manhood. The uncle hired a bandit to kidnap the boy and abandon him in the desert, but the boy discovered a hidden cave in an outcropping. The boy escaped from a ghul that tried to kill him, bringing with him an enchanted sword and a fabulous ruby. Fleeing back into the desert, he met a procession of genies of all kinds, and with them the Grand Caliph of the Djinn, the Most Respected Sultan of the Efreet, the Grand Khan of the Dao, and the Imperial Padisha of the Marids. They had returned to the mortal plane to see if the most beautiful maiden had decided yet which would be her suitor. The boy laid himself prostrate before the terrifying host, and the genies asked him where he had found the fabulous sword and wondrous gem. He told his story, and the genies told him the gem he held resembled the gem of Yalsur, which the genie races had fought over long ago, until a thief took advantage of their distraction to steal it away. The boy offered to return it to him, but the genies asked him to judge which race should keep it, for otherwise they would have to fight among themselves and a thief might steal it again. The boy suggested that each genie lord keep it for three moons, and this is how the four seasons came to be. When the marids possess the gem it is winter, when the djinn possess it it is spring, when the efreet possess it it is summer, and when it is in the possession of the dao it is autumn. The genie rulers rejoiced at this solution, and offered the youth riches and treasure. The boy politely refused any gift, saying he only wanted to return home, find out who kidnapped him, and to be as happy as Fate allowed. The genies, in turn, promised to aid the boy and his descendants, teaching him how to call and bind genies. So it was that he became the first sha'ir. They also granted him a female genie of each of their four races to forever aid him, and when he became a young man, the boy made these four his wives. The youth asked his djinni wife to bring him home and asked his dao wife to bring him his kidnapper. The terrified thief ratted out the uncle, so he asked his marid wife to bring him his uncle, who cursed him and predicted that his nephew's power would corrupt him as surely as the uncle's greed had been his own downfall. The youth instructed his efreeti wife to punish his uncle (she chopped him into pieces and scattered the remains in the desert) and decided to defy his uncle's curse by sharing his power with others, teaching those who could learn the arts of the sha'ir.[17]A confident-looking male djinni in traditional garb.The djinn founded the Calim Empire in what is now Calimshan over 9,000 years ago. Many of them took mortal concubines, and from these unions were born half-elementals, who in turn mated with mortals to produce air genasi.[18]The djinn, in a civilization known as the Djen who might have included some marids and jann among them, were led by a mighty noble djinni known as Calim, bringing with them human slaves similar or identical to the people of Zakhara. Tales tell of another world where the djinn were slaves to humans, and say that they took their revenge by enslaving humans on Toril[19]. They prospered for 1,000 years until an invasion of efreet led by the great efreeti noble Memnon destroyed their civilization over the course of a 200-year war.[20] When the djinni masters were overthrown, many djinn, half-djinn, and genasi were banished to other planes, bound into iron flasks, or slain. The surviving air genasi fled to other lands or went into hiding.[21]As of 1479 DR, the land of Calimshan has been ripped asunder by the events known as the Second Era of Skyfire. After the Spellplague, the Calimemnon Crystal, prison of the efreeti Memnon and the djinni Calim, shattered. The released creatures resumed their hostilities that dated back to the First Era of Skyfire (c. \u22126500 DR).[22]In the wake of the return of Calim and Memnon, many of the residents of Calimshan, presumed to be human, cast off their long held disguises and revealed themselves to be genasi. These descendants of the elemental powers pledged themselves to either fire or air, took over the cities of Memnon and Calimport respectively, and joined the war between the efreet and djinn.[22]In approximately 357 DR, the wizard Martek, called \"The Greatest of Mages,\" served as Bakar's grand vizier. He imprisoned the efreeti pasha Khalitharius and, knowing it would one day escape, he set up a magical quest allowing heroes to resurrect him when the time was right.[23]As part of his preparations for this event, Martek convinced the djinni Aeraldoth, one of the six viziers to the Grand Caliph of the Djinn himself, to allow himself to be imprisoned in the city of Phoenix so that he might battle the efreeti at the crucial moment.[24]",

        "description": "In their true form, doppelgangers appeared as tall, elven, gray-skinned humanoids, whose thin hairless bodies made them appear, to human eyes, sexless. Their heads were bulbous, with formless faces and bulging eyes that were a pale yellow hue and lacked visible pupils. Though even this form was deceptive, as it gave the impression they were physically weak, when in fact they were quite strong and agile.[3]They were lazy but cunning creatures, who killed or disposed of people then assumed their place. While not actually evil, doppelgangers were extremely self-centered and liable to look down on their victims.[6] Because of their laziness and selfishness, they rarely ever had any interest in raising their young.[1]The union of a doppelganger and another creature would produce a child that was either a doppelganger or what was known as a half-doppelganger.[12] However, such children would be unaware of their true nature until they reached adolescence, at which point they would try to seek out others of their kind.[1]A doppelganger in service of Gornak, shapeshifting out of his human disguise.Doppelgangers could assume shapes of any humanoid creatures between 4\u20128\u202fft (1.2\u20122.4\u202fm) in height. After they chose their victim they duplicated the victim's form, clothing, and equipment, and attempted to kill the original. The biggest boon for the doppelgangers was the confusion their shapeshifting caused.[6][5]These shapeshifters were immune to many mind affecting spells, such as sleep and charm spells.[6][5] They also possessed a continuous spell-like ability to detect the thoughts of their victims and opponents,[3][1] which some described as being a form of ESP.[5] This ability extended out 60\u202ffeet (18\u202fmeters) and could penetrate most 2\u20123\u202fft (0.61\u20120.91\u202fm) barriers.[1] These would often use this ability to learn everything they could about their chosen target.[6]Though their abilities allowed them to physically impersonate other creatures, a normal doppelganger could not duplicate the languages, memories, mannerisms, or personality of their victims. Because of this they sometimes kept the original alive and close by for weeks when their plans were more long-term. While captured a victim's mind would be read daily by a doppelganger in order to learn how to best behave and speak without being detected.[1]Being shapeshifting creatures, doppelgangers preferred to surprise and ambush their opponents.[1][5] Once engaged in close quarters combat, a doppelganger would use their brute strength to slam opponents around.[1]They were believed to be an artificial race, created by the Creator Race known as the batrachi to serve as spies and assassins.[14]In the Year of the Banner, 1368 DR, the trading company Seven Suns's headquarters in Baldur's Gate was infiltrated and taken over by doppelgangers, working on behalf of the rival organization Iron Throne. The doppelgangers then proceeded to make poor business decisions that drove the coster toward bankruptcy. This affected the economy of the whole city and attracted the attention of the Grand Dukes.[15]In the Year of the Unstrung Harp, 1371 DR,[note 1] a group of doppelgangers infiltrated a wedding ceremony between Piergeiron the Paladinson and Eidola of Neverwinter in Waterdeep, posing as guards and handmaidens. Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun foiled the monsters' sinister plot but failed to stop Eidola's subsequent abduction.[13]A pair of doppelgangers.Doppelgangers tended to be solitary creatures, though were also known to operate in small groups as part of longer cons,[1] as doing so further ensured that their infiltration and attacks were successful.[6] Many lived a stolen life. When they encountered a person whose appearance or station they desired for themselves, the doppelganger used their mental powers to learn everything they could about the chosen target.[6][1] Once they had all the knowledge they needed, they quietly eliminated[6] or captured their target and assumed his or her form, taking their place in life.[1]Doppelganger families tended not to be close; usually, a male and female met, engaged in casual sex, then left one another, with the female being forced to single-handedly rear any resulting newborns\u2014who left their mother upon reaching maturity. Some, however, formed tightly knit family clusters, while others mated with humanoids, taking malicious delight in using their spouse as a cover for their inhumanity.[12]Doppelgangers were highly feared by most races for their ability to assume the form of any humanoid creature they encountered. Knowledge of their presence tended to make people very paranoid and suspicious of others.[3][1]Whenever food or treasure were scarce they would work for other creatures, though they preferred doing business with the magically inclined.[6] Many beings throughout the Realms were known to utilize them as spies, assassins,[3] or in elaborate plots to usurp power.[6]",

Intelligent horses were also native to the celestial realms of Sehanine Moonbow.[12]Horses were a kind of novelty for Thymari dragonborn, as such beasts weren't common in Abeir.

        "description": "This is a\nGood Article!Dragon turtles were distantly related to dragons and had dragon blood.[17] They appeared as huge turtle-like creatures with a long tail and neck with large, taloned flippers.[3] Their heads had a golden crest down the center.[5][3]The scales of a dragon turtle were generally smooth, but overtime becoming more coarse until finally being molted. By that time the scales had lost much of their durability.[18]The shell of a dragon turtle measured between 15 to 25\u202ffeet (4.6 to 7.6\u202fmeters) in diameter[3] and was strong enough to leave it almost impossible to harm.[6] The shells were streamlined with jagged protrusions.[3] The shell was often a shade of deep green, similar to the color of the ocean, with silver highlights running along the raised areas.[6][3] This meant that a surfacing dragon turtle was often mistaken for light reflecting on the water.[3]Due to the shell's immense strength, shields made from dragon turtle shells were exceptionally tough and had resistance to heat or steam attacks.[5] Their shells were also valued for use as book covers,[19] jewelry,[20] spell components,[21][22] furniture,[23] or as a building material.[23]Dragon turtles were aggressive and solitary creatures who would attack any ships and other dragon turtles that entered their territory.[5] Like true dragons, dragon turtles were obsessed with gold and treasure. They often attacked ships in order to loot the treasure. After sifting through the wreckage, the creatures would carry the valuables back to their lair in their mouths.[1] Sailors wishing to pass through the territory of a dragon turtle found that the creatures were intelligent enough to accept bribes or tributes.[5][7] Sometimes turtle dragons could even be bribed to fight for others, notably working with sahuagin raiders or powerful marids.[1] Some dragon turtles could even master powers of sorcery. Dragon turtle sorcerers were rumored to guard farm caverns in the Undermountain.[24][25][26]A dragon turtle attacks a ship.When in combat, dragon turtles would use their massive bulk to slam into enemies. Dragon turtles were capable of capsizing even large vessels.[6][1][3][5] Dragon turtles could also expel a blast of scalding steam from their mouths.[6][1][3][5]A dragon turtle guarded a vast territory that could expand up to 50\u202fsquare miles (130,000,000\u202fsquare meters). Other dragon turtles were only permitted to enter the territory of another during mating season.[5] Dragon turtles lived in vast caves under the seafloor[5] or hidden in coral reefs.[1] These lairs were used to store their treasure hoards.[5]Dragon turtles were carnivorous and would eat almost anything in order to satisfy their appetite, even other dragon turtles. If food was in particularly short supply, dragon turtles were known to hunt sea birds using their steam breath attack.[5]Dragon turtles generally spoke Aquan,[3][1] Draconic,[6][14][3][1] and sometimes Common.[3]High quality dragon turtle scales, those which had not been naturally molted, were highly valued for the production of armor that was both durable and flexible.[18]As of 1358 DR, a dragon turtle had been floating off the coast of T'u Lung for 20 years. The creature was immense even by dragon turtle standards and was often mistaken for an island. Due to its immense size, it did not see ships as a threat, and when disturbed, it simply left for a better spot to rest.[27]In 1369 DR, the corpse of a young dragon turtle washed up on the shore of the Deepwash. The body attracted scavengers and spoiled fishing in the Deepwash for months.[28] The juvenile was killed by another far older and larger dragon turtle whose territory spanned most of the deepwash.[11]In 1371 DR, a Red Wizard Brazhal Kos developed a successful method of enslaving dragon turtles that were inhabiting Lake Thaylambar in large numbers. Thay was trying to cull the dragon turtle population for years before and after the story of Brazhal's successes spread. The number of hunters on the lake increased dramatically after that, even though many of them died in the process.[29][8] The number of aspiring fishers remained high for a few years that followed. The fishermen could easily be spotted by their unusual gear, nets, and huge hooks, big enough to catch a dragon turtle.[29]In 1372 DR, it was rumored that the harbormaster of Port Nyanzaru paid tribute to a dragon turtle to keep all other sea monsters away.[30]In 1487 DR, Nanna-Sin was resurrected and took the form of a dragon turtle. He then went to protect Djerad Kethendi against the forces of Unther.[31][32]Aremag breaks the surface to collect tribute from a sailing vessel.In Velen, hanging over the hearth at Morgan's Inn was the head of a dragon turtle that was slain by Captain Morgan. The inn had gained fame for this gruesome trophy and the ghost of the sea captain who still resided at the tavern.[38]Linnorms: Corpse tearer \u2022 Dread \u2022 Stygian\nDrakes: Ambush \u2022 Black firedrake \u2022 Dragonne \u2022 Elemental (Earth \u2022 Fire \u2022 Ice \u2022 Magma \u2022 Ooze \u2022 Smoke \u2022 Water) \u2022 Felldrake (Crested \u2022 Spitting) \u2022 Greater \u2022 Guard \u2022 Mind \u2022 Portal \u2022 Rage \u2022 Space \u2022 Vulture",

        "description": "Dretches stood 4\u202fft (1.2\u202fm) tall on and weighed 60\u202flb (27\u202fkg), their squat, rounded bodies heavily contrasting their gaunt, emaciated limbs. Their skin was pale and rubbery, ranging in color from white, beige and blue, and sparsely covered by bristly hairs as well as pulsing, varicose veins.[3] The eyes of a dretch were slanted downward, their noses seemed squashed, and their exposed ears were pointed and lopped. There were many small fangs inside their slobbery, slack mouths, and a pair of claws hung off their hands.[4]As repulsive as they were self-loathing, dretches spent most of their time eternally unsatisfied, arguing amongst themselves and expressing their discontent.[1] What few creatures they could find that were lower than themselves, normally manes, were tormented for amusement so that they did not waste time reflecting on their own pathetic lives.[4] Unfit for accomplishing anything beyond simple tasks, dretches would be pitiable if they were not so contemptible, possessing levels of extreme malice that in some ways compensated for their complete lack of ability.[1]Dretches could summon other members of their kind but this ability had a low rate of success.[3] When it did succeed however, the newly summoned companion could in some cases try to summon more dretches until a small horde was accrued, but this required astonishing luck.[4][3] Their other common power was the ability to release a cloud of noxious gas every day that spread throughout the nearby vicinity and sickened regular mortals caught within it,[1] a substance they also usually released upon death.[2]Dretches could telepathically communicate but could only do so to those who also understood Abyssal.[1]Dretches summoned to fight with gnolls.With their high numbers, dretches could be dangerous threats if they were more intelligent, but alas, they lacked anything that could be regarded as brainpower.[2] They were stupid, slow, quarrelsome, and uncreative creatures, with the main reason for their survival within the Abyss being that they made up an immeasurable horde.[1] They preferred using their sheer numbers to win their battles, their tactics rarely going beyond a mob rush,[2] as they normally ganged up on foes in hordes up to forty strong.[3] This close proximity amplified their horrible stench, and because most demons were immune to poisons, they could normally do this even when others were present.[2]Dretches served as the primary infantry in demonic armies.[7] Because dretches had some concern for their station they were more reliable, relatively speaking, than other cannon fodder troops of the Abyss.[4] At the same time, the cowardly creatures, unlike many other fiends, had some sense of self-preservation instinct.[8] By themselves, they would flee from serious adversity, but their fear of punishment from (and desire to impress) more powerful demonic forces would keep them fighting when one was present.[3]In matters of war, the weak minds of the dretches could be both useful and detrimental. For example, they might be so terrified of those forcing them into battle that they would forget to actually fight, instead running directly at and over their foes. This could unintentionally damage the enemy formation, knocking them down and out of place, and create such confusion and disorder that it ultimately favored the dretches.[9] On the other hand, despite their sense of self-preservation, the dim-witted demons were occasionally known to require instruction to stop them from engaging in suicidal attacks, such as charging into a wall of fire to get to their opponents.[10]Individually, dretches relied upon their claws and demonic resistances to survive.[1]An Abyssal tavern with dretch servers.Displeasure was the most common emotion expressed by the dretches as they milled about in mobs expressing their disdain through hoots, grunts, and snarls.[1] While not the lowest of demons, dretches were the lowest of the tanar'ri, as their mane inferiors were simply demonic spirits.[4]Dretches were well aware of their own low station and individuals had different outlooks and attitudes on it. Some acted as sycophants and helpers, attempting to be as useful as possible in the hopes of promotion, while others felt that their completely miserable situation left them with nothing to lose, causing them to rebel. With dretches being so incredibly numerous, many of them believed they could carve their own path, as they were too lowly to catch the eye of more powerful demonic entities. In truth, rebellious dretches were often slaughtered en mass by more powerful demons, to whom the dretches were free blood to spill.[4]Individually unimportant, dretches as a species played a huge role in the Blood War and the Abyss in general. Tanar'ri constantly warred and fought amongst themselves, possessing no sense of kinmanskip or unity and thus not having as strong an impact on the Material Plane as they could. The key advantage of the demonic forces laid in their overwhelming numbers, and the uncounted billions of unimportant and petty dretches made up a vast fraction of those numbers. Regardless of their overall importance, dretches were used as the rank-and-file soldiers of most demonic armies, thrown at new enemies both for tests and for fun, and were also used as a food source for greater fiends when prey was otherwise scarce.[2][4][12]A dretch on the dissection table.The strange levels of strength in dretches for creatures of their small stature seemed to be at least partially magical, but also was a result of their cable-like muscles. This enhanced the power behind their raking claws, which were thin and as strong as steel. Their brains resembled those of natural creatures such as humans and other higher mammals, but were purple and exuded an indescribable stench.Their abdomens were potentially the most bizarre part of their anatomy and filled with a harmless, if foul, black liquid that swirled around inside them and quickly enveloped the hands of those trying to handle it. Dretches had only a few discolored organs and despite eating most, if not all, organic matter presented to them, they lacked most digestive and excretory organs. Their only digestive system involved an esophagus connecting their mouths to what was presumably a stomach, perhaps indicating that they vomited what they couldn't digest or that the waste was simply oozed out through their pores.[13]Outside of the Abyss at least, a dretch's body swiftly decomposed upon death. Their tendons became pliable and easily severed while their bones could be snapped between someone's fingers. The liquid inside their chest evaporated leaving only a tarry residue, and the odor slowly faded away.[13]A subspecies of dretches inhabited the Shadowsea of Dagon, an entirely submerged layer of the Abyss.[14]Chaotic evil mortals occasionally reincarnated into dretches, manes, and rutterkins after dying in Thanatos, one of the layers of the Abyss.[15]Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

        "description": "Driders were created from drow in an agonizing process. They grew physically stronger and kept all magical and other abilities and skills they learned during their lives.[6]Driders were centaur-like creatures, appearing as drow from the waist up, with their lower portions replaced by the abdomen and legs of immense spiders.[5]Driders were sexless because Lolth did not want to have a race of enemies to the drow.[7]Driders were bloodthirsty.[5] They kept their memories and personalities from their time as a drow but added to this came a sense of shame, hatred, and fear that made them violent hunters. Most harbored a death wish that made them want to die in battle\u2014 preferably when fighting drow.[8]They were tireless hunters and there were two reasons for this. First, hunting was the only thing that could give their lives meaning, second, they needed to drink blood at least every four days or their bodies started to deteriorate from which they could die outside of a battle.[9]As a result of drow repeatedly double-crossing driders and killing them at the end of a bargain, driders attempt to take some precautions to at least take the drow down with them at the time of death.[9]A male drider with a cluster of spiderlings.Driders naturally developed a venom that could sap their victims' strength[10] and paralyze them for upwards of twenty minutes. They could deliver the venom with a bite, or they could alternatively use it as a sticky coating on their weapons. They were immune to all poisons.[8]As mentioned above, driders had a death wish. This and their general unstable mental state made it hard for them to feel fear.[9]Driders could reliably climb like spiders,[10] the only difference between these two species' movement abilities was the driders' inability to walk upside on ceiling, they were too heavy for that.[9]About half of the drider population had the ability to spin webs like spiders. They could do so up to ten times per day and these webs worked like a rope of entanglement. It was dangerous for everybody except for its creator.[9]Their darkvision had a shorter range than those of a drow,[11] though their senses were sharper.[9]All driders could inherently cast clairaudience/clairvoyance, dancing lights, darkness, detect good, detect law, detect magic, dispel magic, faerie fire, levitate, and suggestion once per day.[5] Dhairn once noted that these abilities were essentially the same as those owned by powerful blessed drow and used this fact to dupe driders into supporting his cause by calling them blessed creatures of Lolth by pointing this out.[12]They could also cast normal spells like clerics, sorcerers, or wizards. Those who cast spells like clerics could cast spells from two of the Chaos, Destruction, Evil, and Trickery domain. Their sorcerers often learned the spells, daze, detect magic, ghost sound, invisibility, lightning bolt, mage armor, mage hand, magic missile, ray of enfeeblement, ray of frost, read magic, resistance, silent image, and web.[5]They also had a resistance against magic,[3] but it was much lower than that of a drow.[9]Driders had a penchant for hiding and sneaking,[5] being able ambushers. They often laid traps, prepared ambush sites, and so on around their lairs.[9]They were capable of using weapons, but rarely used armor. They used them for additional protection against ranged attacks but otherwise used their protective gear as ammunition.[9]Once turned into these aberrations, driders left their homes in shame[14] for they were outcasts in drow society.[5]Driders were typically found living solitarily.[9] Though they could also be found living in pairs or in troupes consisting of one or two driders and seven to a dozen monstrous spiders.[3]Driders were created from drow in an agonizing process that required a yochlol, or to be more precise Lolth's power as channeled through the demon, during the ritual that initiated the process.[8] Only drow could be turned into driders.[1] The change could be reverted with a wish spell.[7]When a Lolthite drow reached a certain level of power, that drow underwent the Test of Lolth administered by Lolth herself. Those who fail this test but survive were turned into driders by the Spider Queen.[14]The second category of drider origins were drow mages. Part of the duties of Lolth's clergy was to ensure that their idea of society was kept free of dissidents and mages were put under general suspicion. Once they reached a certain level of power, they were abducted and then subjected to a test of loyalty called the Test. Failures were turned by a Lolthite priestess into a drider with magical energy channeled directly from Lolth.[15]The third category of driders came about when Lolth summoned a drow she considered promising to the Demonweb Pits. They were subjected to a test by the Spider Queen and when they failed, they were turned into driders and sent back.[1]Despite the cultural shunning of driders some drow wizards and sorcerers developed a spell to turn temporarily into a drider, called dridershape.[16]Individual driders could be found outside of drow society and practically everywhere\u2014 including other planes of existence and the Sea of Night on spelljammer-pirate ships.[7]Driders spoke Common, Elven, and Undercommon.[5] They could speak any language they could speak during their drow days, but Drow Sign was hard for them due to their transformation.[7]Drow held driders in low esteem. Driders left the drow cities by themselves or were penned somewhere,[1] or were driven out,[9] when they turned into driders to live as hermits or hunters but sometimes came back to the city's fringes. They were tolerated there as a representation of Lolth's will and as a reminder for the fate of failure to live up to the Spider Queen's standards.[1] Another role of theirs at the city's fringes was that of a buffer and guardian of the city by killing potential intruders.[9]In Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition, the creation of driders was changed from a punishment to a blessing. 5th edition, according to Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes returned the process to being a punishment, and driders were shamefully kicked out of their drow House to wander the Underdark alone.",

        "description": "Comparison of heights; from left to right: a human, sun elf, wood elf, moon elf, drow, and wild elf.In many ways, the drow resembled other elves[22] or eladrin.[23] Their bodies were wiry and athletic,[22] while their faces were chiseled and attractive,[23] though they were shorter and thinner than other elven sub-races.[9][24][10] Due to a process of selective breeding that lasted for several generations,[9] the drow (especially nobles)[24] looked attractive[23] even in comparison to other elven subraces.[25] Though their alluring appearance could be used for seduction, it was more often utilized to instill fear.[23] According to the goblin Nojheim, the beauty standards of the surface races made them prone to turn a blind eye to the deeds of the drow, showing them greater leniency and acceptance.[26]Reports varied on the physical differences between the drow sexes. Some purported that females were generally bigger and stronger than males,[22] while others claimed the males had superior strength.[27] Both sexes varied in height from 4\u202ffeet and 7\u202finches to 5\u202ffeet and 5\u202finches (140 to 170\u202fcentimeters), averaging at 5\u202ffeet (150\u202fcentimeters). Males weighed between 87 to 157\u202fpounds (39 to 71.2\u202fkilograms), averaging 109.5\u202fpounds (49.67\u202fkilograms), while females were a bit lighter, weighing between 82 to 152\u202fpounds (37 to 68.9\u202fkilograms) and averaging 104.5\u202fpounds (47.4\u202fkilograms).[10]Drow skin tones ranged from dark grey,[28] jet-black,[22] and obsidian,[15] (with various shades of blue),[9][24][23] the albino drow known as the Szarkai being an exception.[22] Drow had white, black, or purple teeth, while their gums, tongues, and throats could be red, pink, or purple.[22]Drow eyes could be of any color,[28] with bright red being the most common.[22] Pale shades[15] that appeared nearly white of blue, lilac, pink, or silver were also frequent.[9][24] Drow with green, brown, black, amber, or rose-hued eyes existed, but they were rare. Purple or blue eyes indicated surface elves and/or human ancestry.[22] The color of a drow's eyes could also be indicative of their current mental or physical state; drow eyes reddened when they were angry, and turned yellow when they were sick, poisoned, or under some negative magical influence.[22]Drow hair could be stark white,[22][15] pale yellow[9][24] and, more rarely, silver or copper in color.[22][28] It thinned and changed color with age, turning pale yellow for women, and silver or grey for men.[22] Due to the Eilistraeen ritual of The Run, drow of other faiths would often say that silver hair was a sign of mental handicap.[29]Drow generally kept their hair long, and decorated it with pins and webbing made of precious metals.[23] They were incapable of growing proper beards, but some males managed to grow long sideburns or even tufts of wispy hair on the cheek or chin.[30]The majority of drow wore a piwafwi, a fire-resistant, protective cloak, footwear that functioned as boots of elvenkind, and a drow house insignia. The latter showed the House or merchant clan to which a drow belonged, be it as a member or servant. However, with the exception of the First House, insignias weren't openly displayed except when inside the House territory or the clan's base.[31][31]Noble drow wore clothes and equipment of superior quality (except, of course, when they didn't want to attract attention).[32] For example, a noble's house insignia didn't just show house allegiance but also carried magic that could be used on command.[31] Web chokers' were considered fashionable by drow priestesses,[33] who also often used powdered Ormu, an Underdark-moss, as eye shadow.[34]Compared to other sentient beings, drow were notably intelligent, as having an analytical mindset and being observant at all times was needed to survive in their society.[22] Intellect, along with force of personality, were mental traits that had been ruthlessly selected for in their socially darwinian civilization over several generations.[9] However, a lifetime of being indoctrinated with Lolth's dogma, combined with their upbringing giving them limited contact with other beings, surroundings, and alternative ways of life, made them close-minded, and left them with little wordly experience.[22]The drow (fittingly for the dark perversions of the elves they were) were decadent[23] and hedonistic beings with a love for what they considered beautiful and a desire to surround themselves with it, generally without paying attention to the cost of acquiring it.[28] For example, they were often lecherous, with a tendency to take lovers at their leisure and discard them at their whim.[35] However, the drow were able to (or at least tried to) hide some of their more heinous traits behind a veneer of sophistication.[36][23]The moral code of the average drow was informed by the teachings of Lolth.[23] From birth, the drow were taught that they were superior to other races, and as such they believed themselves to be the ultimate beings.[37][30] This mindset created an arrogance so strong that drow could be incapable of viewing other creatures as their equals,[30] including members of their own kind; almost every drow believed themselves to be the epitome of their superior species.[38] The treatment reserved for non-drow ran the entire gamut from pets,[39] to slaves, to grudgingly respected partners if they proved themselves a military match for them, though never equals.[28]As one might expect, this atmosphere of utter condescension meant that most drow generally felt entitled to do whatever they wanted, whenever they wanted to do it.[28] If a drow was not where they believed they should be, their pride demanded they blame someone else (sometimes everyone else) for their incorrect position.[40] They were also taught that they should crush those beneath them,[37] for cruelty was seen as a method of self-validation. If someone could not defend themselves, as the logic went, they deserved to have cruelty inflicted on them, which would prove the superiority of the drow performing the torment.[41] They were a vengeful people by necessity, as not answering to slights with punishment was easily perceived as weakness by other drow, and was essentially the same as inviting exploitation, abuse, or even death.[35]Most drow sought to rise in rank,[36] desiring the power over others that a higher station would provide.[35] Ironically for a race that put such a focus on individual merit, personal achievement and ability carried so little weight in their minds they had almost no notion of its worth. Military genius, battle prowess, magical capability, the ability to create, and all other skills had no intrinsic value to the dark elves. The idea of passion for one's career, and of an activity having worth in and of itself was alien; abilities and resources, whether obtained by training or granted by birth, only mattered insofar as it increased a drow's ability to advance in station, thus granting them more power over others.[21][42]Given the scarcity of resources in the Underdark and the limited chances for advancement within their society, most drow had to be aggressively competitive.[43] They had a propensity for violence, which was their favorite, even instinctive, form of conflict resolution, and they managed to fight this urge when waiting for a more propitious time to strike.[38]As a general rule, drow living within a Lolthite society couldn't afford to show emotions like compassion or love, for they were easy to exploit[30] and drow often preferred emotional cruelty over causing physical harm.[41] The strife they constantly endured led them to be paranoid, with a fear of everyone and everything, from the potential loss of personal position, Lolth's favor, the loyalty (or even the threat of outright rebellion) of their inferiors, to punishment by their own superiors' hands.[38]The end result of being raised in this environment was that the drow were untrusting sadists with a constant readiness to stab others in the back, both in the figurative and literal sense.[28] They were an emotionally stunted people[32] with a tenuous grasp on sanity (a trait they placed less importance on than cunning and deviousness) and scarred minds, among which relatively undamaged individuals were considered abnormal.[44][45] Most were incapable of trusting other creatures, no matter their race,[46] and were taught from an early age not to do so, as they were expected to advance at the expenses of others by any means, including treachery and even outright murder (although not overtly).[47][28] Even in moments of safety or relaxation, they were always alert and constantly expecting attacks of any kind, and were rarely surprised when such attacks did come.[22]While the drow understood the advantage of forging bonds with others,[30] they did not see the value in honesty.[28] Forming relations with others was therefore a dangerous endeavor, and mostly temporary, since any alliance or cordial relationship could end in treachery. Drow normally went into engagements of this sort expecting the worst,[30] and alliances were always under scrutiny for signs of treachery, often ending violently. They were generally formed when the supposed ally was susceptible to blackmail, considered weak enough to not be a serious threat, or when cooperation was forced by the existence of a common enemy.[48] In fact, the mere inconvenience of maintaining the bond could be a reason to end it.[28]For a race so chaotic in a society focused on individual advancement at the expense of others, the majority of drow strangely leant towards being neutral evil in alignment. The drow were, in many way, contradictory in outlook, cooperating to some degree almost in spite of their very nature. They simultaneously encouraged personal ambition and innovative problem solving (creativity being needed to get ahead of the older elites) while paradoxically placing the good of the many over the good of the individual and reinforcing staunch traditionalism.[42]To achieve their individual desires required their society to retain at least some level of stability, and they were held tightly to tradition even if that code wasn't actually codified into law. In fact, the drow responded poorly to social norms being turned into written rules, obeying them primarily out of fear and social pressure (but obeying them nonetheless). This lead to the phenomenon where a lone drow would drift towards chaos, whereas a drow community would be forced to work together against one another, setting up rules to stabilize the power each individual wanted for themselves and allowing for cooperation beyond what chaos could typically create.[42]Unlike creatures such as orcs,[49] drow had no innate inclination towards evil, with their morality having been colored by their society.[45][50] \"Good drow\" made up about 15% of the entire race, although most of them weren't actually of the good alignment, being merely chaotic neutral or lawful neutral. Within Lolthite societies, even drow with a disposition towards what was considered good generally had problems developing a strong personal sense of morality. They generally behaved the same way as evil drow due to social pressure, as being soft in any way was lethal in drow society and often resulted in the death of such drow.[50]Only truly exceptional \"good drow\", such as Drizzt Do'Urden, were capable of freeing themselves from a Lolthite society.[50] The majority were found out and sacrificed to Lolth, and those who managed to leave their settlements would often die in the dangerous wilderness of the Underdark.[51] Furthermore, even those who escaped the cruelties of the Underdark found it more difficult to form long-term friendships than most races did[23] and had to constantly be on the lookout for pursuers who could kill them.[52]Drow were more agile than most humanoid races,[23] which, much like their higher intellects and force of personality, was a result of selective breeding over several generations.[9] Similarly, drow had a higher than normal tolerance for poison due to exposure over the course of countless generations. They had lesser resistance, in descending order, to the following kinds of toxins: non-drow sleep poisons, drugs, insect venom, and injected poisons. They had no special tolerance for contact poisons or to poison gases.[53]Drow had tremendous resistance to magic, with adults overcoming magic around half the time.[9][8] During infancy it fluctuated between almost non-existent and youth-level (resisting around two fifths of the time), stabilizing as they grew up.[54] It increased again when they reached adulthood, and could be trained even further,[54] but even if a drow's magic resistance was overcome, they could handle magical attacks quite well and had a better chance than other races at resisting them,[54] especially spells that attempted to bend their will.[9]Drow also had a natural aptitude for audible mimicry, the entire race possessing the capacity to easily imitate the sound and tone of another person in a believable manner, especially if frequently exposed to the language they were using.[55].Base powers were abilities that the drow could cast without any schooling, needing only simple practice. They varied slightly from person to person due to various reasons, including but not limited to genetics, personal talent, and divine favor. Drow magical abilities[56] were somehow tied to the faerzress,[57] the radiation of the Underdark, and its intensity in the birthplace of a drow could influence their base powers.[58] These abilities could also vary in the same person temporarily, depending on their personal (mental and physical) health situation, age, and degree of training. For example, a dying drow could double the effectiveness of the own innate powers by super-charging them with her or his own life force.[58]The drow could use their base powers once every day and, once employed, they could end the spell, move it around at their whim, or downsize it. Spells like dispel magic could end a base power's effect. Normally, a drow could not continue using these abilities when they started using another one, or started to cast a spell.[58] A common or untrained drow could neither use nor maintain their innate abilities under the effect of light that was as bright as, or brighter than, sunlight, as it impeded their concentration.[54]A drow's innate dancing lights spell-like ability [9][8][59][15] could create a larger number of light motes than the normal spell, and provided better control as the power of the caster increased; for example, the light spheres could be moved further away from each other than normal.[58] Reports varied if it could also be cast once per day, as with the other base powers, or at will.[58][59]In addition to the normal effects of a darkness spell,[9][8][59][15] which created an area that was impervious to normal sight and infravision, a drow's spell-like variant could also create a globe that could be moved around and grew in radius with the strength of the caster.[58] They could further enhance the spell-like ability to cast it more often, and learn to deepen it so that a daylight spell could not overpower it any more.[60]Unlike the normal version of faerie fire, a drow's spell-like version could create a glowing field that grew wider with the strength of the caster.[9][8][59][15][58] It could come in blue, green, or violet,[61] but while a drow could change these colors, they always manifested a certain one if they made no choice.[62] According to Seldszar Elpragh, a drow's faerie fire worked by channeling faerzress.[62]Upon reaching a sufficient degree of expertise, the drow gained their so called \"mature powers\". These included the spell-like abilities detect magic, know alignment, and levitate.[58][15] Particularly intelligent and powerful drow could maintain two inborn abilities, or one inborn ability and one normal spell, simultaneously, using levitate and darkness at the same time for example.[54] Like with base powers, it was normally impossible to cast mature powers in the presence of intense light.[54]Some drow were born with more magical power than normal, allowing them early access to their mature powers.[63][64] Such drow made up the noble class of their society, and among them this was a dominant trait.[32] Not only could nobles use both base and mature powers more than once per day, but every decade they gained another daily use, with centuries old nobility having virtually unlimited uses. Unlike commoners, they could attempt to cast their inborn abilities even in the presence of light, but they could only maintain one of their spells in this condition even when normally able to do more.[54]Before the 1360s DR, the drow would gradually lose their base and mature powers, as well as their defenses against magic, if exposed to sunlight.[65] However, during the 1360s DR, Liriel Baenre, guided by Eilistraee,[66] carved her rune in the Child of the Yggdrasil with the intent of preserving her own drow magic away from the Underdark,[67] but the act ended up allowing all drow to keep their powers on the surface.[68] Despite Eilistraee guiding Liriel, speculations were that Lolth also had a hand in the matter.[68]Lolthtouched powers, the result of Lolth's blessing, were perhaps the most distinctive abilities of the drow.[23][69] Lolth's touch gave her a hold over the entire drow race, and overcoming it was only possible by becoming a redeemed drow who also managed to judged worthy by Corellon.[70]An image of a Lolth-touched bebilith, drow, and giant spider.Lolthtouched drow manifested abilities like cloud of darkness, which would enshroud the given drow in shadow that was impossible for anyone but the caster to see through, and darkfire, which made other creatures an easier target by surrounding them in harmless purple flames. Lolthtouched powers were seemingly fueled by the same source, and the use of such abilities were tiring for the drow, with only more experienced and well-trained drow able to cast both abilities separately.[71] Through training, drow could manifest the so-called webs of darkness that both slowed and impeded a foe, while also limiting their vision.Curseborn drow could unlock even more Lolthtouched powers, including improvements of the aforementioned cloud of darkness and darkfire abilities. Other ways to improve these abilities included training to cast the cloud of darkness faster in response to harm, or to turn the darkfire into a flickering protective shroud that made the beneficiary harder to hit.[72]Drow were as frail as any other elves,[73] and had a fascination with stealth and subtlety.[28] They had a tendency to ambush their enemies with ranged weaponry, choosing hand crossbows when possible, to deliver their poisons from afar. They also favored light and quick weapons like rapiers in melee but normally retreated if close combat was the only remaining option.[73][74]Specific training was available for their rogues,[28] which included lessons on how to blend in with the heat hues and patterns of their surroundings, similarly to how other races could hide in the shadows of light sources.[75] Their famous (or infamous) assassin schools doubled as assassins' guilds.[76] Male drow were normally competent fighters,[36] and rangers were also valued as scouts.[48]Apart from its obvious use as a light source, drow used their ability to create dancing lights to surprise the enemy with the sudden appearance of a glowing figure or will-o'-wisp-like light balls. Teaming up with actual will-o'-wisps to make this more effective was a known technique, however, this was viewed as corrupted behavior.[73]Besides the obvious utility of cancelling light sources, the drow ability to creaste darkness was an integral part of their combat strategy, as it could be used to limit sight or otherwise hamper their enemies.[77] Since magical darkness looked like black stone when looked at with darkvision, there were many creative uses of the spell form a tactical standpoint. For example, a drow could hide behind the \"black stone\" and ambush their enemies from behind the cover, or use it to cover up a pitfall.[73]Like dancing lights, faerie fire could be used as a diversion, but the ability to change the colors of the lights allowed for the creation of color signals for the purpose of long distance communication.[73]Lolthtouched drow sometimes trained to slip into the cover of their created darkness,[72] or learnt to hit the targets of darkfire not just more accurately, but also harder, similarly to how drow wanderers did.[78]The drow had a number of combat styles:Drizzt Do'Urden; a master of the draa velve style.Drow with weapons drawn.Drow weapons and armor were made out of a substance called adamantine, an alloy of adamantite, and then turned into drowcraft items. Such equipment could not withstand sunlight,[79] but was cheap and easy to produce.[80] Before the 1370s DR, every drow warrior, down to the lowest rank, was equipped with a drowcraft chain mail and (in most cases) buckler as well.[81] At some point during the early 1370s, these items fell out of favor[82] and the drow started to wear mithral armor when it was affordable, but they kept using armor that wouldn't hamper their natural dexterity.[74]Famous weapons included the bolts of power, death lance, whip of fangs,[83] drow mission blade, hand spinneret, and the queen's scourge. A well-known drow-made piece of gear was the death armor, legendary in the Underdark.[84] The drow created some weapons with the specific purpose to fight their own kind, namely the flash globes and light pellets.[85]A drow falling victim to the calling, a magical poison.Among the Underdark races, the drow were the most skilled in the use of poisons and toxins.[74][86] Especially famous was the powerful drow knockout poison, made from a slippery black fungus that grew in certain Underdark caverns, and commonly applied to crossbow bolts to easily put enemies to sleep.[74] Other popular poisons were those extracted from purple worms, scorpions, and spiders,[74] the so-called calling, the eyeburn paste, and the skullrot.Almost every drow put some individual effort into strengthening their tolerance to poisons as part of their training. This was done by ingesting ever-larger doses of drow sleep poison and of spider venom, granting them further resistance to such toxins.[53]Their massive use of poisons led the drow to developed the virulent weapon enchantment to enhance the effects of any toxin applied to their weapons.[87] Naturally, the drow had some countermeasures against poison, like the ring of antivenom.[88]The priestesses of drow socieities formally occupied the positions of military leadership, but in practice it was the male commanders that actually led such forces. The priestesses often hid away in the face of danger, while resorting to the use of corporal threats and magical domination to ensure loyalty.[32] A military squad formally led by a male drow, was either a streeakh, a suicide squad, or a dobluth, a group of outcasts.[36]When drow nobles warred against each other, the attacking side had to eradicate the entire enemy family in a single attack. If even one member of the defending family survived, they could apply for \"justice\", and the entire city would turn on the attackers. Alliances were not allowed in these kinds of attacks, and there was a minimum interim time (one year) between attacks on an individual house, giving them time to recuperate.[89] Prolonged covert warfare between two houses, by means like assassination, were not exactly forbidden, but it was only tolerated for a time counted in years, after which the drow city's ruling council forced the two houses to enter open war.[90]This was the reason why drow society was in a perpetual state of very small-scale battle of underhandedness, instead of a series of bloody frontal battles.[91] Making matters worse for the drow, in war situations, the noble Houses schemed against each other so that their rivals would take the heaviest losses, or carry the responsibility for any failure, meaning that they were incapable of forming a truly united front against their enemies.[92]War in the Underdark was far different from conflicts fought on the surface. The cramped space of the subterranean environemnt made it hard or ineffectual to amass giant armies, and most battles were actually skirmishes between small units or patrols.[93] The drow avoided large sieges and pitched battles, in favor of focusing on skirmishes, as well as hit-and-run tactics and harrying strikes.[94]Underground warfare heavily involved the use of the natural environment as a weapon through the creation of tunnels to flank enemies, cause cave-ins, change the flow of magma, and so on.[93] The drow used ambush tactics that exploited existing dangers like loose rocks, and were skilled in using traps, such as deliberately placed phycomids or glasses full of ascomoid-spores, to gain an advantage in combat.[95]The drow also had a knack for responding to their enemies' actions, including spellcasting.[95] The members of a patrol coordinated by using infravision and counting what they called \"handfades\", a unit of time based on how long it took a rock to lose all heat after being touched by a hand.[34] However, they were aggressive, if not outright impatient, and one way to gain an advantage on them was to taunt their warriors long enough for them to make a fatal mistake.[94] Their method of warfare, especially considering their enlistment of slaves and allies, could drag on for years.[93]A drow assailing a group of devils.While the exact equipment and size of drow warbands varied from place to place, it was possible to make some general assumptions about the composition.A drow patrol usually consisted of seven to twelve soldiers headed by a patrol leader and overseen by a commander, the latter of which normally had a maximum of three other individuals, either acolytes and apprentices or bodyguards, in tow. Ordinary drow patrols contained a maximum of around six individuals with basic training, the rest being elite warriors. These warbands normally included a mix of both male and female drow, with a homogenous patrol likely indicating that the tension between the sexes in their city was reaching a critical point.[96]Patrol leaders were normally male drow with superior fighting skills or clerics trained in the use of weapons.[93] Larger patrols were generally led by female drow, who normally had one or two powerful warriors as lieutenants.[94] An elite patrol was usually led by a female cleric with female bodyguards, and her \"acolytes\" were also female clerics of the same church. These patrols were special, for they had an additional cleric with healing duties who also worked as a spy for the church of Lolth.[94]A \"pincer\" was the name for a collection of several patrols (two to four) led by one commander, usually some kind of spellcaster called an \"overleader\" or \"battle-captain\", who had up to four lieutenants called \"webmasters\".[94] Ranking higher than battle-captains were \"battle-lords\" or \"warmistresses\" which had an entire patrol force as their bodyguards and to carry their magic items. Each House had a standing army of drow soldiers, priestesses, and wizards, which included contingents consisting solely of non-drow slaves, usually bugbears, ogres, and minotaurs.[28]Around three out of every ten drow patrols included somewhere between one to eight non-drow, such as bugbears, goblins, or orcs as \"allied forces\". Mind flayers were never a part of such groups, except when being escorted to a destination.[96] When a drow died in battle, they were sometimes reanimated as a zombie if the lower half of the body was still functional. This was done to prevent the corpse from getting plundered, to provide the corpses a method of self-transportation, to provide the injured and immobile dead bodies with transportation, and to gain useful shock troops to use in battle.[75]All warriors in a patrol usually equipped with short swords, daggers, up to three javelins (with an atlatl to extend their reach), a hand crossbow with ten poisoned darts, and a buckler for protection.[93] Patrol leaders were equipped with a hand crossbow, javelins with an atlatl, and a moderately enchanted mace to indicate their authority.[93]:During wartime, the patrols doubled their numbers of poisoned darts, and every warrior was equipped with up to three potions of healing in steel vials that didn't rust.[94]Patrols were outfitted with a scroll of protection from earth and stone to guard against cave-ins, while surface raiders or underground furtive attackers used an orb of duo-dimension to allow stealthy attacks.[97]Lolthite, drow society had had two nominal goals, called \"the First and Second Part of the Destiny of the People\". The former was about forcing all other races of the Underdark into subservience, while the latter was about driving the entire elven population into extinction, seizing their lands and holdings in the process.[46] Lolth claimed that, in order to achieve such goals, the drow had to be in a state of perpetual infighting and violent competition, the constant training serving to make them stronger and smarter while breeding out indolence and other weaknesses.However, the extreme, self-destructive degree to which the Darwinian attitude of the drow was taken prevented them from achieving either of their purposes, barring possibilities for significant growth.[98] In truth, despite her rhetoric, Lolth had no intention of having the drow devote themselves to reaching their supposed goal. She found their in-fighting far too enjoyable to focus their attention of taking the surface.[99]On a personal level, each drow tried to gain and maintain the favor of Lolth, amass material goods (like wealth and slaves), and gain status inside their society.[30] Depending on the station of a drow, there was a difference in the kind of plans they supported and executed. Drow of higher standing supported endeavors to boost their own prestige by increasing their own people's power and influence. Drow of lower station supported plans that dragged everybody down, for example by causing strife and violence within their communities.[46]Drow communities were known as city-states, although they weren't actually organized as \"states\", as much as clusters of drow lead by oppressive, theocratic nobility. Cities were normally independent and not part of a larger drow nation, and though some had trade agreements, most frequently fell to war with one another.[76] Cities usually included farmlands, where slaves worked to produce and harvest meat and crops.[76] Those lands were usually found inside the main cavern but sometimes, usually due to space limits, they could be found outside as well.[100]A drow stronghold.Drow architecture, like typical elven works of construction,[101] put an emphasis on beauty and was considered a marvel to behold.[102][28] The drow were the best architects when it came to shaping and hollowing out stalactites, stalagmites, and cave columns. They were also known for their stone bridge, balcony, and buttress designs, as well as their intricate spiral tunnels. Suspension bridges were the norm, for they could withstand earthquakes, and cave fishers were trained for the purpose of slinging their lines.[103]The drow used the very environment of the Underdark as material for their architecture, and could make use of growing sedimentary structures to shape their buildings.[104] They were particularly interested in the magimorphic clear black stone, because creatures with darkvision could see through it.[105] In some cities, clay was used by the poor, similarly to how to was used in Kara-Tur and the Shaar, to create dwellings. The same craft was used by the rich to create temporary furniture and sculptures for their parties, which were then decorated with gems, glowing fungi, and similar material.[106] As far as dwellings went, noble drow usually lived in their mansions while the commoners lived in either small caves or walled, circular houses with dug-out cellars and adobe-like construction, both designed to be as beautiful as possible.[31]Despite their excellent craftsmanship, drow cities tended to be a chaotic and messy sight because of the lack of a uniform architectural style.[76] Common features in drow cities were the presence of spider webs in passages and layouts of buildings,[31] and frequent obsidian-cast spider motifs as decorations.[105] Lighting was created both through magic and mundane means, with the former being far more common,[75] and the continual faerie fire spell commonly adorned particularly impressive structures, the borders and landmarks of a given city-state, buildings belonging to the wealthy, as well as the working places for slaves outside of the city.[75][107][76]Magic in general was a key element in drow architecture, with crucial structures often supported by spells rather than being carefully built to stand on their own (which could cause them to collapse when the magic wore off). In the event of collapse, rubble was cleaned out by slaves, only for the drow to use magic like stone shape and the barest minimum amount of handiwork for reconstruction. It was this slapdash approach to their architecture that meant that instability issues in drow cities had a tendency to persist.[102]The drow were mostly met in the Upperdark, but the majority of their cities were found in the Middledark as a protection against aggressions from the surface. In fact, traveling all the distance down to the Middledark with an army from the surface wasn't a feasible undertaking.[98] The gates of a drow city, as well as its important buildings, usually had jade spider guardians.[108]The places in the Underdark where drow built their city-states had to meet sevaral criteria. The caverns had to be huge,[28] allowing a horizontal layout of the city,[109] great amounts of iron, adamantite, and gems needed to be nearby, and the magnetic force and the faerzress needed to be particularly intense,[110] both for practical reasons and, according to Qilu\u00e9 Veladorn, because the drow had a mental compulsion to be near the radiation and were drawn to it.[111] Whatever the reason, when the faerzress disappeared, the drow-city usually collapsed too.[109]The faerzress radiation near most drow cities provided protection from magical spying via divination, and also made it difficult, or even dangerous, to teleport within the area.[112] Furthermore, the faerzress allowed cheap and easy creation of magic, drowcraft items,[80] and the radiation had several defensive purposes.[98] For example, drow often used shriekers, a type of fungi that grew in faerzress-rich places, to warn them of incoming danger.[110]However, the drow's relationship with faerazress could be as much a weakness as it was a strength. Their over-reliance on it meant that drow settlements were often stationary, leaving them relatively easy to locate and vulnerable to attack by various the forces of the Underdark.[79] The radiation was also uniquely capable of causing mutations in other creatures; a flying roper, for example, could be born in a faerazress-rich environment. If the product of such mutations was powerful, drow tried to avoid fighting it and keep it within a certain area so that would-be invaders would have to face it instead, turning it into an unwitting sentry. If the creature had a spider-like appearance, the drow would praise it as the work of Lolth and occasionally feed it with captives or lured adventurers.[110]A specialty of the drow was their ability to cut and shape stone, both with magical and mundane methods, to produce smooth-flowing buildings, and waterworks were a product of drow craftsmanship that received universal acclaim. Systems of intricately curved pipes that bore through solid rock, fitted with shut-off valves, side-channels, and pumps, collected and diverted water for various purposes, from dietary, to industrial, to waste disposal.[113]The valves were big, hollow stone spheres with two opposed holes, closely fitted into a basin, which had both inlet and outlet channels. They were attached to a large, counter-weighted lever that, when turned, lined up the inlet and outlet channels with the holes of the valve to let water come through. The flow was regulated by opening a sliding panel, which turned the sphere in such a direction that only the volume of water that filled it could pass through and be diverted towards a side-channel. The aforementioned pumps had two varieties: a corkscrew-type, that worked by water pressure, and a piston type, worked by slaves. Constant application of magic was needed to make the water seals function perfectly.[113]Most members of a Lolthite drow society lived under oppression, in a state of perpetual desperation and poverty.[76] Commoners normally learned a craft or entered military training, while talented individuals could hope to enter one of the magic schools. Ironically, commoners had a greater number of multi-generation households, since their relatives had less to gain from their death, resulting in families who had many living generations of members. There also wasn't much to be gained from killing an elder (at least one that wasn't feeble), as they represented a valuable source of historical and general knowledge with realistic accessibility,[32] although they elderly would be eaten if the city was faced with overpopulation.[46]Commoners who gained enough expertise in a certain area, like Zaknafein Do'Urden as a warrior, might be adopted into a noble family.[32] From time to time, artists were adopted by one of the Houses for their skill.[114] Commoners could also rise to a higher social station by becoming the consort of a noble, gaining the latter's last name for the duration of the marriage.[115]Consort bonds were generally of temporary nature, however, due to accidental breeches of etiquette, the noble's disinterest, or because they were simply being used as a pawn in the political games of Lolthite society. The outcome was either a painful death or expulsion\u2014usually the former.[32] In general, rising through the ranks too quickly was dangerous for any drow, as the usual reaction was the formation of temporary alliances among those who believed they wronged to take the upstart down and such alliances were often successful.[43] Nonetheless, noble drow valued commoners more than slaves, and usually sacrificed them only if a slave was not at hand.[32]A matron of the drow.See also: List of drow housesDrow were ruled by their aristocracy, the drow Houses, made up by the families that had the strength and incredible influence to occupy the best lands,[32][23] with most Houses often being located in close proximity to each other. While the nobles hoarded the best territory and resources, the rest of the population was forced to fend for themselves. These priestesses of Lolth that normally reigned over drow societies were poor rulers who tossed their cities into a haphazard organization.[76]Noble Houses constantly fought each other[8] but were also characterized by internal strife,[109] as expected in a society that followed the Way of Lolth.[28] Though the power of the many Houses changed often, the few at the top usually remained stable.[76] A good indicator of a drow House's power was the grandeur of their domain, with the biggest, grandest villas belonging the the greatest Houses,[101] and a public temple to Lolth often being built within the strongest family's territory.[76] Not only did the infighting of drow Houses paralyze the growth of their own cities,[98] but they actively undermined opportunities and chances for any form of development in order to ensure that those below them didn't gain power (and with it, the option to turn away from Lolth).[116]Drow Houses were founded by powerful drow individuals with special powers, whose traits would be passed to their offspring (see under Noble Powers), and further augmented with magic items. Within a family, noble drow parents viewed their children as vehicles for their own advancement, a mindset which included sacrificing them for some potential gain. Noble drow families banded together for mutual protection and not out of affection. Noble drow stayed with their family as children to protect themselves from outside violence, and as adults because Houses proved to be good tools for societal advancement.[32]The head of a noble House was a matron mother, a powerful priestess of Lolth. Below her, in descending order of influence, were the female members of the House, who were also priestesses.[109] After them came male officers, including the weapon master, House wizard, and patron (the matron's consort), although these positions could be combined. Then came the other male members of the House (war-leaders, who answered to the weapon master, and House mages, subservient to the House wizard). Below the non-officer males (who were normally of the House's bloodline) were servants and slaves. Positions were normally sorted by age but were ultimately not set in stone, and could be changed at the matron mother's whims[90]Females had absolute power within their household, and owned all the governmental and militaristic power within the city, although they held no authority until after puberty. Males never held any authority unless they managed to become an officer. In most cases, a matron only lost her position if murdered by her eldest daughter. This usually marked a new direction for the House, and sometimes even its destruction, because the murder of a matron was seen as a sign of disfavor from Lolth.[36][90]A Lolthite drow society was a theocracy with ultimate, absolute power invested in the ruling priestesses, particularly the matron mothers. Technically the only rule was \"might makes right\",[119] and the priestesses were judge, jury, and executioner (or whatever other punishment they saw fit to enact). There were no concepts like \"guilt until proven innocent\" or \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt\".[120][119] The priestesses saw it as their right to arrest and punish people for assumed offenses via methods they made up on the spot, and the only way to lessen a punishment was for the presumed criminal to have connections to those that the punishing priestess or priestesses considered a threat.[120][119]However, as the priestesses had power invested in them by the Spider Queen, the actual basis of drow society law was the Way of Lolth.[109] The priestesses of the Spider Queen forced others to comply with Lolth's dogma, which in turn became the main law.[120] Fittingly, one of the main tenets (the first one, in fact) was that Lolth was the only true goddess, and that anyone worshiping another deity or practicing a different faith was to be sacrificed to Lolth. Ritual worship by non-drow was punished with a heavy fine and temporary exile from the city with second offenses carrying the death penalty, along with first-time offenses by drow. To even utter another god's name was frowned upon, although not a real cause for punishment.[119][89]While violence and property crime was punished in drow society, it wasn't because such acts were believed to be morally wrong. A drow vandal, petty thief, or burglar would face charges, but the stolen goods would not be hunted down since, in drow eyes, the fact that the previous owner couldn't defend it meant that they didn't deserve to keep it. Similarly street patrols violently punished anyone fighting, but the victim of the assault was expected to defend themselves against their assailants. Even drow Houses were punished for the open murder of their enemies, just as they would if their assassination was exposed, but this was because public fighting was considered boorish.[119][89]In truth, drow law was nothing more than a formal excuse for cruelty, an ironic parody of order made only to disguise the chaotic, ruthless, murderous ambition of the drow and their infighting. For the most part, there was no prescribed criteria for how justice was to be performed, and punishments could very easily be wildly disproportionate to the crime. \"Justice\" was a senseless and arbitrary institution with no due process or appeals system (unless one counted leveraging their connections) capriciously enforced at the cruel whims of the ruling tyrants. Though certain acts did carry penalties, the only actual crime (the part they were truly being punished for) was getting caught.[119][89]It was considered a violation of the Way of Lolth to defy the hierarchy of their society in any way. This included but was not limited to killing spiders (which was possibly not an actual rule, but could be considered taboo), a slave disobeying their owners in any way, a commoner refusing the orders of a priestess (an exception being if the commoner belonged to another house, although even then the offended priestess was often allowed to flog them), and a student refusing the \"courting\" of a matron or female teacher.[119][89]Drow society also had a strict fashion code (which included rules about hairstyles) meant to allow easy identification of a drow's social station and House (if any). Any drow who committed identification litigations by wearing the wrong hair style, clothes, and/or drow house insignia was considered a criminal unless the House authorized the use of their color or insignia or if the matron mother expressedly permitted a drow to change their hair and attire to appear as a different rank. It was also illegal for non-drow to disguise themselves as a specific drow, a noble drow, or a member of a House outside of the one they belonged to.[119][89]Failing to completely exterminate the drow noble line of another House in a single attack, more than one House teaming up to attack another (one of the few offenses that had to be proven) or attacking a drow House within a year of the last attack against them were all offenses.[119][89]Given the wickedly whimsical nature of drow law, punishment for many of the above offenses (especially refusing one's superiors) could range from immediate execution, death by torture, torture without death, mutilation, castration, imprisonment, exile, forced labor, whipping, and exorbitant fines (which the priestess could keep). Whipping and torture were the most common penalties since the priestesses enjoyed punishments that could be inflicted multiple times. Violation of the fashion code, disregarding exceptions due to authorization by the appropriate individuals, was always punished by death.[119][89]Failing to fully obliterate another House or allying with another to do so was a crime punished by all other Houses destroying the offenders. While attacking a House in short succession wasn't technically punished by law, the offending Houses's priestesses would lose Lolth's favor and be unable to cast spells until they performed a great deed to regain it. This practically assured a House's destruction as they were forced to fall back on diplomatic and physical methods of defense, with all other Houses able to attack them with impunity.[119][89]A leashed male drow protects a female drow.Under Lolth's dogma, female drow were recognized as being more valuable than males, who were considered worthless. This gave female drow absolute power over males,[109] and meant they were less likely to be sacrificed.[32] It would be easy to imagine, therefore, that drow females, had it much easier compared to males, but this was merely an illusion. In drow society, where rank was power and power was everything, a prestigious position came at a high cost. Drow ambition combined with the other teachings of Lolth meant that the competition between female drow, particularly those who belonged to powerful houses, was violent, aggressive, and lethal in a way that males didn't have to deal with. It was even worse for those women who sought power outside of Lolth's church, for they had to compete both with other females and oppressed and resentful men.[122]Still, males who hoped to find any place of power often resorted to ends as treacherous as the women that ruled the drow. Men generally tried currying favors with women, attempting to advance their station by attaching themselves to them. For example, some tried to gain high officer positions or win a coveted place as the consort of a powerful matron mother.[37] Drow \"courting\" was the domain of women in Lolthite society, and for a male to try initiate a relationship was a form of insubordination and a reason for execution by torture and sacrifice. In general, drow women chose their partners as animals would be chosen for breeding purposes, with males expected not to resist the other's affections. Males had no chance on when the relationship would start or end, while females could do so at their leisure, at least in theory.[32]When a drow male was desired by more than one female, the latter would compete over him. This was by no means a positive circumstance for the male, as a female who lost might decide that if she couldn't have them then no one would. More than once a female would \"give up\" on a male before flaying him and leaving his corpse in a rival's bedchambers,[32] and a discarded male would more likely end up dead than left alone. Among commoner drow and in non-Lolthite socieites, matters weren't so extreme. The concept of marriage existed, but was not as permanent, with contracts lasting for a decade or so at longest with the potential for renewal. Merchant clans followed similar rules, but marrying into a clan meant being part of it for life, and trying to leave could be the same as inviting death.[115]A working long-term relationship between drow was likely not the result of love, but due to tangible reasons, like complementary careers, political influence, attractiveness, or the male having a history of fathering many female offspring. Any actual affection was usually the result of the male being attractive, servile, and never embarrassing the female. The best \"normal\" romantic relationship between two drow was similar to the one between a spoiled brat and her well trained, obedient dog, with the owner having the right to put the dog down for any reason.[32]Arcane magic was a route for power for male drow, though open only to a few. While they were still socially inferior to female drow, they weren\u2019t in real danger of being killed by a priestess, while even accomplished male war commanders were in danger of being executed for perceived insults.[32] Other ways of gaining station as a male were to become an arcane devotee (but it didn't grant any additional safety), or an arachnomancer, taking advantage of the reverence of spiders that came with the worship of Lolth.[123]Male clerics existed among the drow, but in Lolth-dominated cities, they were targets of her female followers, and Lolth barred them from achieving power beyond a certain threshold. They served in low-ranking positions under lethal risks,[124] and though capable of becoming divine disciples, it often caused the priestesses to kill them.[123] Other drow deities had different approaches to gender. Ghaunadaur had no gender restrictions,[32] while Vhaeraun's faith had a gender barrier that made it harder for women to become his clerics.[125]Eilistraee accepted clergy of all genders and races, although before the 1370s DR, her actual clerics could only be female.[126] This was less due to any supposed inferiority of males, but because becoming one required a greater understanding and sensitivity of the \"life of the other gender\u201d. For lack of better terminology, one simply couldn't truly feel the Divine Dance of Eilistraee \"properly\" except as a female, and so her rare and secretive male priests had to spend some time as a female, not just for the duration of a ritual called the Changedance, but in everyday ways. However, during the 1370s DR, Eilistraee started working towards opening up to male priesthood: for a time, males still had a harder time becoming clerics (see also here),[27] but after the Second Sundering, Eilistraee's clergy could be accessed by people of any gender with equal ease.[127]Given the need to compete for limited resources and advancement opportunities in their society, drow had an interesting relationship with children. On some level drow recognized that the children were the future of their race, the vulnerability of young drow to magic for example having led to the development of the potion of magic resistance.[54][46] However, an honest bond of love between parent and child in drow society was even rarer than one between lovers. Instead, the relationship between drow and their children was frequently one of mutual exploitation, each using the other as a tool only so long as they still needed them.[32] A child born with physical malformations or imperfections, due to the drow obsession with beauty, was killed shortly after birth.[115]Due to their competitive society, drow tried to instill the ideals of tenacity, cruelty, ambition,[43] self-reliance, and independence in their children.[115] Since traits like kindness or compassion were considered dangerous and exploitable,[30] children who showed such weakness were punished. Punishment ranged from beatings to neglect, such as withholding food, with the goal of the abusive treatment being to prepare the child for the cruelty of their future lives. These punishments could prove lethal, and the inevitable child deaths were justified as \"saving\" the child from an even worse fate as an adult. Drow children learned cruelty and bloodthirst both as a survival mechanism, and as a defensive mechanism to escape punishment, and these lessons generally scarred a drow and stuck with them for life.[43][30]This was when a drow's parents were actually in the drow's life. Noble drow weren't raised by their parents, whom they only rarely saw a few times a year, but by elder siblings and private caretakers before being sent to the city's priesthood, military, or wizard academy depending on gender and inclination. In effect, each was a kind of boarding school for children over ten years old, which normally only allowed them to return home once per year for important family or religious meetings.[32] Merchant clans[115] and commoners (who lacked the resources to hire tutors) considered raising children the entire family's duty, before they learned the parent's craft, enrolled in the military, or joined a wizard or cleric academy. Whether noble or commoner, children generally lacked any strong parental bonds, being both physically and emotionally distant to their absentee parents, thus limiting the emotional growth they could achieve in a more normal (by surface standards) home environment.[32]The drow held some respect towards races capable of resisting their aggressions,[28] and could perceive certain races as at least possible equals (though never superiors) with whom they had mutual gain or non-aggression pacts. However, contracts with \"lesser races\" were not seen as actually binding, and were readily broken as soon as they stopped being beneficial to the drow party. As a result, the other races learned to anticipate betrayal and always had counters to the treachery prepared.[46] Normally the drow had poor opinions of even their erstwhile allies, and viewed other races, at best, as merely laughable or contemptible.[74]Two drow watch over a gladiator match as one of them eats grapes.The drow's ultimately viewed other races as somewhere between targets of extermination and potential slaves,[28] foes to be either dominated or, if they were a threat driven to extinction. As such, drow had an extremist mentality when meeting with them, their first thought being to wage war on the new neighbors in order to subjugate or eradicate them. Prisoners of such violent activities were the source of slaves in their cities.[74] Normally somewhere between half and two-thirds of a given drow settlement's population consisted of slaves or other non-drow without rights,[28] although only Houses possessed significant amounts of slaves. In some cases the number was rarely above the House's drow population[128] and in others the slaves outnumbered them either two or three to one.[74]As a general rule, the inhabitants of Toril's surface knew very little about the drow. To the average person, the drow were such a distant problem that they were considered more like myth than reality.[43] Given that they couldn't do anything effectively in bright light, drow were inactive on the surface during the day.[73] As a rule of thumb, only 5% of surface inhabitants had the superficial knowledge that the drow were \"inhabitants of the Underdark who conducted raids on the surface\", not including elves and eladrin, who had close historical connections. This made it easier for individual drow to enter surface communities without meeting hostility as long as they didn't do or say something that could catch attention and lead people who had real knowledge about the drow to cleanse their community of the threat the drow represented.[43]Even so, surface cities generally didn't allow drow into their cities because of their reputation,[73] though followers of Eilistraee sometimes managed to gain a place within surface communities.[129][130] Their unique appearance combined with their negative public image made it practically impossible for them to effectively replenish their resources on the surface.[73] Intelligent creatures on nearly every plane in existence knew of, and maintained at least a respect for, the drow.[121]R.A. Salvatore (March 2006). Exile. (Wizards of the Coast). ISBN 0-7869-3983-4.The drow didn't often keep animals as pets, preferring to keep creatures that could completely comprehend their dependence on their owners. Instead, many drow took a favored slave as a personal servant or thrall, slaves that were treated as little more than pets. They did however, domesticate a number of animals for various purposes, and were known to take advanage of molds, fungi, and oozes by using them as traps and for sanitation.[74]Barring the most primitive among them, the drow were a literate race.[76] As was common for elves, drow speech was quite eloquent and their speech was almost musical.[55] Most drow only knew two languages, namely Deep Drow and the Sign language, since they usually stayed in their cities and therefore had limited exposure to or need to learn other tongues. However, drow adventurers, outcasts, and slave-traders often learned more languages,[55] as did their warriors.[76] Drow were known to use their ability to read subtle markings in stone to leave secret messages.[75]Drow names often included double letters and were designed to be pleasant to the ear.[8] They believed that having first names similar to those of the Dark Seldarine guaranteed misfortune, and names similar to that of their patron was considered blasphemy.[191] Nobles had a strong tendency to avoid giving names that were similar in sound to the common tongue of Deep Drow.[191] Drow last names never started with the \"L\"-sound like that of \"Lolth\", \"Lloth\", or \"Loethe\", as this was reserved for the Spider Queen's avatar. Holding a last name, in general, meant that the holder was either born into a noble family, or had a rank and role (like weapon master) in a household. Drow that didn't meet those criteria weren't allowed to have a surname.[192]Drow house glyphThe drow had a number of customs and gestures. For example, it was a commonly accepted gesture to drop held weapons and fall on a knee as a sign of surrender. There were many rituals as well, like the graduation ceremony for the graduates of the mage, priest, and warrior schools.[193] When participating in a meeting, due to their weakness to light, the creation of an intense light source was seen as a hostile act by the drow, that led them to attack.[54]Some known drow rituals and customs included:Due to the dark elf love of beauty, the demand for art and skilled craft, particularly exquisitely forged weapons, was high.[115] Good artisans, especially innovative ones (which made up about 0.1-0.4% of the population), were highly sought after by the noble Houses. Families that didn't produce artistic talent on their own acquired it from the outside (be it by simple hiring, forceful coercion, or the rare adoption into the family).[198] Noble households often had their own exclusive sculptors and gemcutters.[199]About a fifth of the entire drow race was capable of complex works, while only about one-tenth could create items fine enough to be enchanted or turned into drowcraft through the absorption of faerzress. Even though capable artisans weren't few among the drow, there was a great shortage of such talents compared to the demand, and both nobles and merchant clans tried to have at least six on their payroll. Overall, artisans were among the most intrigant and paranoid drow. They used tricky devices like clothes with built-in items, gas-powered needle-throwers, extensile mechanical hands, wire-saws, and similar devices to defend themselves and break out of cages and prisons.[198]Artwork and craftwork of the drow were often made out of materials like metal and cloth. They frequently included spider motifs, such as the curtains positioned to emulate spider webs that often adorned noble Houses. [199] An art form unique to the drow was the use of continual faerie fire to create murals or to highlight temples.[107]Almost all drow were born into typical drow culture, and were known as Udadrow. These were by far the most common type of drow, and the only type known to most.[200][201] Drow that remained loyal to Lolth were known as Lolth-sworn drow.[202]Not all Udadrow became a part of the violent mainstream culture that most of the race were forced to endure. Those few who escaped the life of the Underdark could break away entirely from their dark past, while some fortunate drow were actually born and raised outside of the world below. Some drow found virtue within themselves in spite of all the terrors they witnessed (or perhaps because of it). Others turned to better ways either out of guilt or simply because they were no longer forced to obey Lolth's dogma. Still others were dangerously insane, broken by the horrors that shook their psyches.[45]The drow who chose to live on the surface, outside of the churches of Eilistraee and Vhaeraun, did not form any kind of organized society and instead lived as hermits and outcasts. They would interact with other societies when needed, but not out of choice.[76] Drow who wandered the surface in an attempt to settle their conflict with Lolth and each other were known as Seldarine drow.[202]Though many drow followed the way of Lolth and became Udadrow, some rejected her. A mysterious band of drow headed to the far north and were seemingly never heard of again. This offshoot of drow became starlight elves, Aevendrow, who were skilled mages and lived in a much more free society. They were incredibly secretive in nature and virtually unknown, even by the oldest elves of Toril, living in their icy home of Callidae.[200][201]Similarly to the Aevendrow, the greenshadow elves, or Lorendrow, were a practically unheard of group of drow that rejected Lolth's teachings. This group headed south to a tropical jungle environment and drew power from the environment itself. Such drow were very wise and sought to live harmoniously with nature in their forest city of Saekolath.[200][201]The majority of all drow worshiped a group of divine entities they collectively referred to as the Dark Seldarine, a name intended to mock the original Seldarine.[203] Though having a group name might suggest some sort of alliance, the Dark Seldarine was a pantheon only in name. The only thing that technically united them all, outside of a few short-lived alliances, was that each was a deity revered by a fraction of the drow.[204] With few exceptions, every entity within the Dark Seldarine demanded absolute fealty from its adherents.[204] The Way of Lolth, for example, made clear that Lolth was the only true divine being, and to follow any other faith would bring down a series of awful punishments on the perpetrator, including death.[205]Unlike the elves, who often venerated one member of their pantheon above the others while still paying homage to each of their deities,[206] the drow would choose one, sometimes two, gods or goddesses from their pantheon and ignore the rest.[204][207] As a result, while deities like Bane, Cyric, and Shar had millions of worshipers[208] but only 135,000, 250,000, and 100,000 dedicated church members respectively,[209] the number of worshipers of a Dark Seladrine member was nearly equal to the size of their church.[204]The relationship between the drow and their gods was one of mutual exploitation (with the exception of the one good-aligned member, Eilistraee). Most were not worshiped out of any sense of true piety or devotion, but out of fear, respect, and/or personal ambition. Likewise, most drow gods were intimately involved in the lives of their followers, but not because they genuinely cared about them; each demanded total, exclusive obedience, and did not care what happened to them outside of how it affected their personal power.[204]There were two major faiths among the drow:[74]Malice Do'Urden sacrificing Zaknafein Do'Urden to appease Lolth.The drow as a whole held to many different religions outside of those accepted by most of their society. It was believed that the \"good drow\" collectively worshiped Eilistraee,[149] drow goddess of freedom,[217] although in truth the more morally neutral of the \"good drow\" were split between the worship of Ghaunadaur, Selvetarm, Lolth, and Vhaeraun.[218] Some drow living in Waterdeep also followed the gods of the Seldarine.[54] The following faiths were of minor importance:[74]Zedarr, a drow blackguard of Kiaransalee.The magic of the drow was on par with that found on the surface.[231]There was a number of spells associated with the drow, but not all had been developed by them. While they were known for the ability to create spells, and some of the magic known on the surface had also independently been developed by the drow, they also stole quite a lot of arcane knowledge from the surface by kidnapping casters during their raids.[232] For example, the vipergout spell was originally developed by the scalykind,[233] but was still considered drow.[234] The drow had also created a number of spells that summoned or imitated spiders and their webs, like giant spider, spidereyes, summon spider, passweb, spellweb, death spider, spider bite, and spider climb.[235]A drow wizard casts ball lightning.Drow were not just avid inventors of magic items,[231] but also the main crafters of magic items in the Underdark.[236] Similarly to spells, while some items were associated with the drow, not all had been developed by them, as they were known to steal magic items and related knowledge from the surface during their raids. Nonetheless, certain items had been developed by the drow, or based on magic from before the Descent,[231] and most of those items were created to be only usable by drow, due to their paranoia.[76]The drow loved magical items of any kind, and all powerful families gave some enchanted items to those who served them. The piwafwi was a notorious example, although insignias were also important to the drow houses and granted special powers like, sometimes, levitation.[76]Drow had an aptitude for rune magic,[76] elegantly limning runes in black paste, ink, or inlay. There were three categories of drow runes and glyphs: the house defense glyphs, used by the most powerful drow to defend their houses and treasures, the way-marker runes, used to guard places with drow traffic but no permanent population, and the sacred glyphs, only found in sacred sites of Lolth.[76] Runes could be enchanted with a glyph of warding spell,[237] and drow runecasters could create unique ones for locations of importance.[76]Drow priestesses and wizards often created magical scrolls to give their warriors an edge during their patrols. Overall, the drow used scrolls more often than surface races and were also known to create unique ones.[88]Drow practitioners of path magic organized their spells in the so-called Path of the Drow, also known as Lolth's Road, or the Spider Road. It was considered a lost path, i.e. generally unknown to other races.[238]While the drow misunderstood psionics and distrusted its practioners, as in most societies, the dark elves were different in that their extensive dealings with duergar and illithids made them more familiar and somewhat more excepting of it. Though their leaders were skeptical of it, working to ensure it didn't threaten them, they often saw it as a useful and unexpected tool in their arsenal.[239];Like any other civilization, the drow had craftsmen, farmers, and businesses but these were undercut by the priestesses of Lolth and the nature of their society. Not only did Lolth's chosen purposefully undermine opportunities for growth to retain their grip on power (too much change too quickly risked giving the lower class a dangerous taste of freedom), but while supposedly expected to do so, they had the authority to take items from businesses without paying. If a priestess particularly liked the products, this could cause a business to go bankrupt despite the owners' efforts, leaving the destitute workers with no choice but to enter a contract that essentially made them slaves to the priestess.[116][32]In general, drow society didn\u2019t have unemployment or homelessness issues, as those who fell in either or both categories were naturally dealt with. This could mean that they suffered indiscriminate violence, were used in murderous sport by drow nobles, or were simply put to work as slaves. Many drow signed up into the military because the risk of a violent death there was lower than as an unemployed or homeless individual. The constant demand for soldiers, no matter the level of skill, allowed such course of action.[32]A member of Bregan D'aerthe, a drow mercenary and mercantile group.The second greatest power group inside a given drow city were the merchant clans,[240] whose success was important for the survival of the drow race.[90] The clans were among the primary mercantile organizations in the Underdark, and their presence was common along its trade routes.[100] Contrary to the Houses, merchant clans were run by male drow, since females considered interaction with outsiders to be too demeaning and dangerous for them. Outside the environment of the drow cities, merchant clans and noble Houses openly fought each other.[240]Merchant clans had some variation, but often had a few rules in common. The lowest ranking members, almost exclusively non-drow, were called \"assets\", and made up the labor and military force of the organization. Male drow of merchant clans generally had no inhibitions when it came to interacting with other races, including surface-dwellers, because they knew that there was no chance of advancement within their society for them. In fact, many of the \"second ring\", as the managers of a merchant clans were called, were non-drow. A council of male wizards, called an \"inner ring\", ruled over the clan.[240]Only the most experienced and worldly drow of the merchant clans were capable of forming genuine friendships with the so-called lesser races, including mind flayers or duergars.[146]In typical drow society, where the the concept of inherent value of life did not exist, slavery was an important practice.[28] ,[30] All unskilled labor in drow cities was carried out by slaves, and for that reason the slave trade was a booming business. Slaves were not only captured but also bred,[74] or bought from sellers like the humans of Calimshan, Thay, and the Plain of Horses, and the orcs from the North.[146]The drow didn't see slaves as a valuable commodity, but as a cheaply and easily replaceable tool that they were allowed to treat cruelly and exploit at will.[146] Slaves, in general, were not allowed to look into the eyes of a drow or to carry weapons without permission (a rule that was mostly enforced when the slave was a gladiator of some kind).[146]Given that all unskilled labor in drow cities was carried out by slaves, and that surface dwellers were considered to be the best for that role, surface raids were vital for the maintenance of the economy.[128] No matter the size, these attacks had the primary objective to capture people, with looting considered a matter of secondary importance.[128]Large raid parties, consisting of hundreds of members that sacked entire cities, were rare. Most raids only involved small bands, and started with scouting operations, followed by either open bloodshed or by infiltration to kidnap potential slaves. Sometimes both methods were combined; one drow group could catch the attention of the residents, for example through arson, while another force fulfilled the actual objective of kidnapping people undisturbed. Due to the drow's weakness to sunlight, the attacks usually happened at night and ended before dawn.[128] To take advantage of even the smallest cracks that constituted an opening to the surface, orbs of duo-dimension were used in these assaults.[241]Drow slavers marching prisoners.It was common for injured drow to make use of a prosthesis, as craftsmanship in artificial limbs was advanced and easily available. They were made from adamantine, worked as well as the original limbs, and could also be situationally weaponized or equipped with parts functioning as specialized tools. For example, exchanging a hand with a claw or sword for combat was possible. From time to time, non-injured drow used this technology for their body-extensions, like toe-claws to kick-stab their enemies.[243]The drow were particularly proficient in designing ways to move and store goods, from trade-containers to harnesses for beasts of burden and mounts. This technology was born out of a high demand for goods that had to be carried to drow cities from distant places, like crabs or fish found in the Underdark, which their patrols carried in so-called \"wet basins\" made of clay, or fruits and other surface-only goods, which they obtained by means of trade and raid.[106] The drow also developed magic items that helped transportation of both people and goods, like the driftdisc, the floatchest, and the walking chest.[244]As a general rule, drow had a preference for smooth or cabochon cut gems over faceted ones, and preferred black, blue, and red to other colors. Gems of silvery hues were used as contrast when it couldn't be provided by metal. Gems were usually worked in rings, wristlets, gorgets, belts, pendants, or collars.[245]Drow of average wealth wore banded agate, blue quartz, crown of silver, eye agate, hematite, malachite, obsidian, jasper, moonstone, onyx, rock crystal, smoky quartz, zircon, aquamarine, garnet, jade, jet, pearl, spinel, and tourmaline. Nobles, powerful wizards, officers, and priestesses wore other, more prized stones like amethyst, beljuril, black opal, black sapphire, diamond, emerald, fire opal, jacinth, opal, oriental amethyst, orl, ravenar, red tear, ruby, sapphire, star ruby, star sapphire, water opal, and zendalure. When it came to the priestesses, the amount, rarity, and variety of gems that they wore was on a higher level than all other drow. Other kinds of gems were often used as currency for trade with non-drow.[245]Drow were the most wide-spread and numerous among the Underdark races.[28] They lived in about forty city-state scattered around the Upperdark and Middledark,[109][118] primarily in the latter. Drow were usually only sent in the Lowerdark as scouting parties, or as some kind of punishment for angering a matron.[246]Drow preferred to live in areas that fulfilled certain criteria. As a result, most of their settlements were found under the Moonsea, north and west of Iltkazar, from the underground of Calimshan to the one of Icewind Dale. Their sphere of influence, however, was much larger.[109]Some notable drow cities were:The term \"surface drow\" referred to all individuals who spent less than four consecutive days below the surface in their regular life.[50] Surface drow had no love for bright light, open sky, and loud noises, and a preference for darkness.[50] Most surface drow were followers of Vhaeraun, not Lolth,[211] and the vast majority of Eilistraee's followers were also on the surface.[109] Among the surface, drow was not a huge problem like in the Underdark.[211]A number of them embraced a truly different morality than most of their brethren, either because born on the surface, or because of a decision to abandon the way of Lolth. Some of those who came to the surface from the Underdark had already formed a different morality before leaving, while others had used to live under the Lolthite dogma. Among the latter, certain individuals were haunted by their past deeds, sometimes to the point of being broken by the weight of their horrible actions (even becoming a danger due to their mental instability), while others were truly unapologetic about their behavior in the Underdark, and pushed all responsibility on the necessity of it.[45]Many drow on the surface were actually spies still loyal to Lolth, sent to infiltrate the enemy and gather information for their matrons. However, the more time a drow spent among its enemies, the higher the risk that drow would defect in some way. In some cases this was to undermine a rival house by perpetuating false information, while others began sympathizing with their foes, even to the point of believing they were undeserving of the hate they received and the violence their kin would inflict on them.[252]Surface drow, while ignored by others, were attractive to the merchant clans, for they represented a contact to the surface for trade. For example, some surface drow managed to become traders who traded with Calimshan, Chessenta, Mulhorand, Waterdeep, or Zhentil Keep.[50] That said, the majority of surface drow lived as hermits or found employment in rather unsavory areas of expertise where their heritage was an actual advantage, like adventurer companies or assassins' guilds.[253]Sunbathing; the result of years-long training.Initial exposure to sunlight was dangerous for a drow and cause of heavy sunburns. Even after getting used to the sunlight, drow had a strong tendency to cover their skin and head when exposed.[260]Drow eyes were sensitive to heat, possessing infravision up to a range of 120\u202ffeet (37\u202fmeters). Formal education or much practice was needed to \"read\" heat hues, as the drow had no innate ability to discern the meaning of the various patterns from birth. Cold objects appeared grey, while heat was seen, in ascending order of intensity, as blue, purple, red, and warm yellow.[75] They also had darkvision up to the same range, but not the low-light vision characteristic of other elves.[9] It took a drow about ten years of exposure for them to get used to the sunlight and to use their infravision and normal vision simultaneously.[260]Drow had excellent hearing, a trait developed by necessity given the paramount importance of foreseeing rock shifts, collapses, and other hazards in the Underdark. It was also the primary means by which they found water, by listening to the dripping sound it made. They had long, slender fingers and a keen tactile sense, to the point of being able to read subtle markings on stone as if they were Braille. On the other hand, drow had a human-like sense of smell, far less keen than in the other Underdark races and than their other senses. Smells were dulled in the Underdark, and the ubiquitous smell of damp rocks and the fungi-riddled air of their natural environment, combined with the strong incenses and the scent of slaves in the drow cities, made it difficult to develop a keen olfactory sense.[75]In contrast to creatures such as dwarves or deep gnomes, who had a deep, intutive sense of stone and subterranean conditions, the drow race's specialty laid in the sculpting of stone, the cutting and shaping of rock into smooth-flowing forms. About 70% of drow had an intuitive understanding of how fortifications or waterworks were constructed, operated, circumvented, and controlled, an innate \"feeling\" that extended to works made by other races.[114] They could recognize drowcraft items by holding them,[114] and if given a piece of Underdark-metal, or a cut or worn gem, drow could typically identify it. Upon finding a vein, like dwarves or deep gnomes, they had a sense of its direction, richness, and dimensions.[261]Drow liked to eat live animals because they believed the meat had a better flavor.[262]Like all elves, drow required no sleep, instead entering a meditative trance while retaining full awareness of their surroundings. The trance lasted around four hours, and provided the same benefits as a member of any other race having a full period of rest.[23][59]However, while elves relived parts of their memories, including those of past lives, during their trances, drow normally experienced nothing, save for the occasional dream (which they tried to interpret by looking for signs from Lolth). The fact that drow didn't relive memories of past lives during their trances was viewed as an indication that, unlike the elves, their souls didn't reincarnate.[203]The drow were believed to be more fecund than other elves,[263] though in truth, they simply had a higher readiness to birth as many children as possible during their lifespan.[32] For example, in the average Lolthite society, a female drow with an active career under her belt gave birth to about ten children before she lost the ability to birth more.[115]Drow lifespans were comparable to the rest of the elven race (and therefore far surpassed those of humans),[23] but the constant strife of their society kept their numbers low,[263] dropping their actual rate of population growth to dwarf-like levels.[96] Provided they did not meet a premature and violent end, a drow's natural lifespan was about 750 years.[10] They started to show signs of aging at around 600 years,[264] and rarely lived past their seventh century, with about 94% of natural deaths occurring before 800 years of age.[265]Drow who could afford a lifestyle that spared them hardships, like matron mothers, could live more than 1000 years (though, by that point, they would be withered by age). Lolth's magic could maintain a matron's life for thousands of years, and this was considered a clear sign of favor from the goddess.[265]There were a number of races and creatures that were in some ways related to the drow.Various elves; from left to right; Drow, wild elf, sun elf, wood elf, and moon elf.Some races were not related to the drow because they were born from them but because they were transformed from drow.The history of the drow is filled with confusion and uncertainties. Many fanatical drow told lies and fabrications about their own history to serve the ends of the noble Houses and of the faiths.[284]At times, pieces of history were entirely deleted from the records. It happened to fallen noble Houses, as all information about them was erased,[284] to deities, as the matron mothers tried to hide all records of Eilistraee's existence,[216] and even to individual drow. For example, when a masked traitor, a specialty priest of Vhaeraun who served as a spy in Lolth's church, was found out, any information about the traitor was literally extinguished from historical records, as if that person never existed in the first place,[285] and by four generations the fabrication was accepted as \"fact\".[284]The drow descended from the dark elves of Ilythiir, the first and one of the most powerful elven nations, and, in minor part, from the survivors of Miyeritar.[9][286][267][48][287] One might imagine that the drow would constantly boast about this heritage, but the truth was that they didn't appreciate being reminded of their origins, for it also reminded them of their deep fall from power.[286] An exception was the church of Vhaeraun, whose goal was to elevate the Ilythiiri to their former glory.[124]On the other hand, the drow remembered their origins because their feud with the elves was based on history. They believed to have been punished by the Seldarine for their triumph in the Fourth Crown War, and used this as a justification for their entitlement to exact vengeance on the other elves and their gods.[18]Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

        "description": "Known for their mysterious nature, druids called the wilderness their home, emulating the ways of wild beasts and other creatures of nature. Believing that nature's health depended on a precarious balance, druids believed that the four elements of the natural world - air, earth, fire, and water - must be prevented from ever gaining advantage over one another, lest the world become dominated by the forces of the elemental planes. Likewise, druids believed nature exists outside of civilized conceptions of good, evil,[11] order or chaos, instead seeking only to maintain a natural state of being which most of the civilized world cannot or will not understand.[12] But though druids may have accepted cruelty in nature, they abhorred that which was alien to it, violently opposing the existence of aberrations and undead, both of whom were affronts to the natural order.[13]A druid's symbolPowerful sentries of the natural world, druids were often seen by outsiders as primal controllers of the wilderness. However, although druids drew great power from nature, druids, nigh universally, did not see themselves as masters of the wild but rather its servants, much as a cleric might serve a god or a knight his liege.[8] To a druid, claims of power over the wild was something that only those lacking a proper understanding of nature could profess. The primal power that druids drew upon came to them not through control, but through a spiritual unity with the forces of nature. This distinction was, however, lost on most.[12]Druids were not the only caretakers of the wilderness, though they were perhaps the best known. Comparable to wizards, druids were nature's lorekeepers, possessing an enormous degree of knowledge about the inhabitants, locations, and phenomena of Toril's wildernesses. However, while wizards frequently sought this knowledge for knowledge's own sake (or power's), druids acted in behalf of that which they studied.[12] Venerating the natural world in a belief system sometimes known as the Old Faith, druids valued the pristine wilderness, accepting its cruelty and ugliness along with its wonder and beauty.[11] As such, while druids rarely acted selfishly, they were nonetheless as likely to be good or evil.[12]Druids shared a brotherhood of sorts with all other druids, though it was often a loose association rather than a tightly bound network. Ignoring the artificial boundaries of kings and princes, druids respected and protected all the lands of the world, working with druids from far-away lands as readily as with those whom they know personally.[14] Communication within this society was aided by the use of a secret language common to all druidic circles, known as Druidic.[15] Induction into these societies often required knowledge of secret rites and passing dangerous tests, but, once accepted as members, druids were rarely cast out and were allowed to more or less carry on their work in their own way.[12] Many of these societies were religious in nature and tied to a church of some sort, but not all were, and most druids preferred a degree of distance between civilized churches and the Old Faith.[16] Of the gods worshiped throughout Faer\u00fbn, druids found themselves most frequently drawn to Auril, Chauntea, Eldath, Malar, Mielikki, Silvanus, Talos, and Umberlee, known to many as the First Circle, the first druids.[17]Druids were most often elves, gnomes, or humans. A few druids also came from other racial backgrounds, such as gnolls[12], ghostwise halflings, lightfoot halflings, or wild dwarves[10], though, generally, druids were uncommon among other races and cultures. Druids as a whole rejected civilization, and as a result sometimes found it difficult to get along with those who embodied its values most distinctively, such as paladins, rogues, or arcane spellcasters. Druids instead preferred the company of individuals with like minds, such as barbarians, rangers,[12] shamans, or wardens.Throughout Faer\u00fbn, druids were most commonly found in regions where pristine wilderness remained undisturbed, such as Aglarond, Chult, the Great Dale, the High Forest, the Moonshaes, the North, the Vast, the Vilhon Reach, or the Western Heartlands. Before its devastation during the Spellplague, the Chondalwood was another center of druidic activity. While druids were more stereotypically associated with lush forests or jungles, druids could also be found in the care of mountains, deserts, lakes, and the swamps of the world.[18]Cormyrean druids referred to the clerics of all the woodgods, such as Mielikki or Silvanus, as \"treecloaks\".[19]There were no druids in the lands of Kara-Tur and Zakhara.[20]A druid summoning her loyal wolf.Druids were capable in a number of diverse skills related to the care of the natural world, such as the ability to perceive changes in the environment or interact peaceably with wild beasts. When it came to martial ability, all druids were proficient to some degree in the use of light or medium armor and shields as well as clubs, daggers, darts, javelins, maces, quarterstaffs, scimitars, sickles, slings, and spears, with the notable exception that druids would not use armor or shields forged from metal.[21] Druids were also able herbalists, adept in the creation of various potions and remedies.[22]In addition to their more mundane abilities, druids were also adept in the casting of spells born of primal magic,[15] sometimes known as \"evocations.\"[23] Druids were also capable of enhancing these spells through a number of magical aids, such as sacred plants like ash, mistletoe, or yucca,[15] as well as through constructed implements like staffs or totems.[23] Like clerics or wizards, druids also knew how to cast rituals. Additionally, with sufficient experience, the intimate connection between druids and the primal magic they wielded grew so strong as to slow their aging, down to a rate of approximately one tenth that of regular members of their species.[24]Among the more formidable abilities known to druids was a form of shapeshifting known as Wild Shape. This ability allowed druids to shapeshift into any beast,[15] including some plants, as well as several fey, or an indistinct being of feathers, fur, or claws similar to the Primal Beast spoken of in many druidic legends.[25] The ability to Wild Shape came with certain limitations, however. Neophyte druids, were, for example, incapable of assuming a beast capable of extensive swimming, and only with a great deal of training could druids master the form of flying creatures. With practice however, the ability could become quite versatile and experienced druids could learn to cast spells in their beast form. The most experienced druids, known as archdruids, were even capable of shapeshifting at will.[24] Others learned how to extend their shapeshifting abilities into taking the form of any individual person.[26]Other druids had less common abilities. Some druids had, in addition to their wild shape evocations, animal companions that filled some of the functions provided by wild shaping. A few druids were innate experts in the fields of botany and zoology, identifying various species with perfect accuracy by instinct. As a result, druids were naturally keen to deception by wildlife and fey. Likewise, druids held a natural sense for the safety of drinking water and many were immune to the effects of organic poisons. Several druids were also masters at moving through the wilderness at fast speeds, ignoring the hampering effects of natural hazards such as thorns or briars. With enough training, these druids did not even leave a hint of their movement through the wild.[26]In addition to the loose fellowship shared by all druids, druids were divided into more localized organizations known as circles, many of which shared certain common beliefs and abilities.[14] Some of the most popular circles are listed below.An elven druid of the Circle of Dreams.Druids of the Circle of Dreams maintained a strong bond with the Feywild and counted themselves among the allies of the benevolent fey creatures of the Realms. They protected the bountiful, often dreamlike locales in the wild, instilling in those they encountered a sense of wonder and dreamlike fantasy that could uplift even the most downtrodden.[28]Drawing from their benefactors of the Summer Court, these druids could offer additional healing to others by means of their naturalistic balms. More experienced Circle of Dreams druids could even draw upon powers of the Gloaming Court to form shadowy refuges, within which they could rest without worry of harm or intrusion. The most skilled of this order could readily travel through fey crossroads and venture into the dreamscapes of others, by means of illusion or divination. Several times a day they could even teleport to any location upon which they last slept.[28]A gnomish druid of the Circle of the Land.Those belonging to the Circle of the Land were among the most knowledgeable and sociable of druids, meeting frequently in sacred spaces to discuss and pass on mystic lore through the oral tradition. These druids often served as kind of liaison between the rest of druidic society and the civilized world, serving as advisers and priests to local communities that remained true to the Old Faith. Members of the Circle of the Land were generally more magically adept than other druids, gaining access to a number of extra spells as well as the ability to restore their expended magic through meditation. Their affinity for magic also gave them immunity to certain forms of elemental or fey magic, as well as to virtually all forms of disease or poison.[29]Druids from the Circle of the Land were often deeply entwined with the land and the people they served, and their primal magic frequently took on a form which reflected the local landscape. For example, a Druid of the Land living in an arctic climate could cast sleet storm or cone of cold while one living in the Underdark could instead cast gaseous form or insect plague. Likewise, druids with a moderate degree of training in the Circle were able to move through nonmagical difficult terrain such as thorns or spines with relative ease and even possessed some resistance to magical forms, such as the vines created by an entangle spell. The close connection between Druids of the Land and the wilderness they served also helped them in encounters with wild beasts or plants, who instinctively hesitated when attacking experienced members of the Circle.[29]A half-elf druid of the Circle of the Moon.Favored by those who preferred a more solitary path, the Circle of the Moon was an ancient association of druids devoted to the mastery of the Wild Shape. Gathering only occasionally under the cloak of darkness to discuss news or pass on warnings, Druids of the Moon often went weeks without seeing another druid or even simply another humanoid. Enjoying the flexibility their Wild Shape ability offered them, druids from the Circle of the Moon were prone to employing a wide variety of shapes, as the situation required, or the druid's own whims decided; the same druid might go one day as a great cat and the following as an eagle.[17]The effort Druids of the Moon put into mastering their Wild Shape ability had many benefits. Even neophyte members of the Circle could shapeshift more quickly than other druids, and with additional training they could employ far more powerful beast forms than those available to other Circles. With experience, more advanced aspects of Wild Shape became available, such as the ability to overcome magical resistance or to transform into an elemental. The most experienced Druids of the Moon could control their shapeshifting ability to such a subtle degree so as to emulate the effects of the alter self spell at will.[17]",

They lived with respect to nature and accepted the company of those that did so as well. Attractive men who were fond of nature were often taken in by a dryad as both her mate and guardian.[citation needed]Dryads were generally benign, and attempted to warn off intruders. Only those who were particularly cruel and determined to destroy a dryad's forest saw the full wrath of these fey.[citation needed]All dryads were magically bound to a single tree. These trees served as the dryad's life force and home. They fought to the death to protect their bonded tree, as should the tree be cut or destroyed, the dryad died soon afterward. A dryad could not stray too far from her bonded tree without suffering the same fate. If a dryad left the vicinity of her tree for too long, she died.[3]Acorn of far travel: If a dryad spellcaster cast this spell on an acorn harvested from her bonded oak tree, she was considered to be in contact with her tree at all times, regardless of the actual distance between them.

        "description": "Like other dwarves, duergar were typically thick, stocky figures, though beyond this there were many differences. Both male and female duergar were typically bald, with females also lacking the capacity to grow facial hair. Many were also thinner than their dwarven brethren. Most obvious, however, was their dull gray skin and hair, often matched with an equally stolid expression.[10] Regular dwarves said they had flat heads, possibly as an insult.[17]Because many duergar found on the surface world were criminal exiles, a surface dweller who encountered one of the gray dwarves was likely to notice facial and arm tattoos that marked the duergar as a traitor to his or her people.[10]Tyrannical, grim, industrious and pessimistic,[11][18] the lives of the gray dwarves were bleak and brutal. Rather than a flaw, however, they viewed their lack of happiness as their greatest strength, the defining feature of duergar pride. The duergar saw themselves as the true paragons of dwarvish ideals compared to their weak and pampered kin, but in truth, their ways were a dark reflection of those found in normal dwarves.[18]While they did display the redeeming virtues of determination and bravery, duergar took dwarven flaws to their logical extremes. They were violent and hateful, sullen and insular, greedy and ungrateful, deeply cynical of others' motives and dutifully tracked and nursed every grudge, whether or not any offense was meant.[19] Though their vices were many, the moral failings of the gray dwarves could be traced to three primary principles: bottomless greed, unceasing conflict, and rejection of emotion.[20]Most dwarves were accustomed to the inevitability of struggle to be found in existence, but such knowledge was colored by their essential love of industry. Dwarves enjoyed their work, from the art of crafting to the trials of their everyday lives, seeing opportunity for success where others saw labor.[9][21] In contrast, duergar industriousness was spurred on simply by the primal urge to build and create, driven by a need to own and acquire as much as possible.[18][22] The duergar were dauntless perfectionists[11] who never left a job half done and worked hard to excel in their field,[19] and yet the dwarven ideal of achieving mastery of a craft meant nothing to them.[9]Duergar creations weren't flawed or subpar, and in fact were rather enduring, but were completely utilitarian, considered valuable only for their function and bereft of warmth and artistry. Appreciation of beauty had been erased from their minds, the aesthetics of their creation ignored. Their works were not labors of love, for their goal was not quality, but quantity, an attempt to craft as many items as possible as fast as possible. At the heart of duergar efforts was simply desire, an insatiable desire for wealth and prestige. Yet even when their great schemes to acquire succeeded, the success was never cause for celebration, each acquisition just as incapable of satisfying their unending need for more.[18][20][9][2]The higher a duergar rose and the more items they possessed, the stronger they would need to be to hold on to what they already had.[20] They were not above stealing to get their beloved gold, and by making war on others they demonstrated one of their principles: might makes right. The weak were unfit to possess what was meant for the strong and those too weak to defend their holdings or themselves were considered by most to be unworthy of pity. Most placed little value on the lives and possessions of others, or at least their rights to these things. The helpless, weak, and less fortunate than themselves earned little mercy, yet all-consuming envy was harbored for anyone relatively better off.[20][19]The suffering of others was one of the rare times that the duergar could feel some semblance of happiness. They enjoyed tormenting those vulnerable to their predations, but this was not to be mistaken for the wasteful and extravagant displays of cruelty shown by the drow. Rather, the duergar enjoyed more \"down-to-earth\" suffering, working others to the death and using cruel jokes and petty abuse to bring a momentary smile to their faces.[11][19] The closest they came to feeling true joy was when satisfying their violent urges and desire for treasure, especially when raiding dwarven strongholds to do it.[22]To show weakness was a mortal sin to the duergar, whether on an individual or societal level. To their minds, weakness included such emotions as happiness or kindness,[20][9] and they had no tolerance for those that failed to show the proper levels of ambition and cruelty.[16] While regular dwarves showed a lack of trust to outsiders, they had strong family bonds, their dedication to furthering their clans and leaving behind a proper legacy showing in every aspect of their activities. The duergar inverted this value, for while they were bound by their rigid society, they did so because they had to, and indeed had no love of their kin.[9]The gray dwarves were consumed by feelings of bitterness, convinced not only that their race had been denied their due, but that the world, other dwarves, and even their own kin and clan had cheated them of their birthright.[11] They were forbidden from trusting others[9][20] and raised from a young age to believe that betrayal was simply their inevitable fate, a self-fulfilling prophecy.[11] Though the duergar were assigned life partners, this was merely to ensure the continued survival of the clan, for life in the Underdark required cooperation. The creation of a legacy was not considered because they had abandoned individuality, each member of society expected to perform their determined role as best they could.[9]In the eyes of the duergar, life was nothing but harsh endless, toil, working from the cradle to the grave in ceaseless labor and drudgery. They were taught that this was their lot in life early, and so expected nothing else.[11] In many ways, their lives were fundamentally empty, a hollow, unfulfilling version of the dwarven way of life. Despite their many accumulated treasures, their successful military operations, and all their pride in the purging of their weakness, the duergar felt no happiness or satisfaction.[18] Indeed, they had no memory of what it meant to be happy, or even what it meant to be truly proud. They simply continued to toil and grumble about their lives, existing as cogs in a machine to forge products they cared not for, a life antithetical to joy and purpose found in the dwarven cycles of creation.[2][18]On the positive side of duergar behavior, they shared the dwarven virtue of minding one's own business (at least as long as others didn't have something they wanted). Though most were evil, a fair number leant towards hardhearted neutrality, wanting nothing more than to be left alone, and a rare few managed to become good.[19]Duergar were in some ways even better adapted to underground living than other dwarves. While other dwarves lacked the capacity to see completely in the deepest darkness, this was not a problem for duergar. Duergar were also immune to many of the ancient techniques used by the mind flayers to control them, such as paralysis, phantasms, alchemical poisons, or some types of illusion.[10]Duergar were also a sneaky, crafty people, unlike their honor-bound cousins, and often excelled at setting up ambushes or moving out of sight. Conversely, many were also good at detecting hidden objects. A few duergar also possessed natural abilities akin to the enlarge and invisibility spells. This came at a cost, however, and duergar, like drow, had a special vulnerability to sunlight.[10]Duergar adventurers were most commonly concerned with personal gratification, and were frequently fighters or rogues, leaning on their training against the threats of the Underdark. Because of their cruel nature, experienced duergar adventurers often became assassins or blackguards.[11]Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V of Gracklstugh.Duergar were, as a whole, generally cruel and malevolent creatures, but as in most evil races this was as much a cultural affectation as a psychological trait.[10]Duergar would often ferment fire lichen into their alcoholic beverages, to create a hot and spicy drink.[15]Duergar primarily spoke Duergan, a dialect of Dwarven descended from the dialect of the shield dwarves and heavily influenced by mind flayer and drow words found in Undercommon. Duergar themselves were commonly fluent in Undercommon, the lingua franca of the Underdark. Other common second languages for duergar were those of their enemies, such as Draconic, Drow, Giant, Goblin, or Orc. Others might learn Terran in order to conduct trade with earth elementals, while others learned Common to trade with the surface world.[11]As worshipers of Laduguer, the duergar had a long tradition of crafting that went back to their days as the rulers of Barakuir. Like other dwarves, duergar were fine craftsmen with an eye for detail, though they were often pragmatic enough to eschew the ostentatious decorations of their kin, which they felt were not only wasteful, but which could potentially give away their presence when treading the Underdark. Additionally, duergar art, unlike that of their brethren, was notable for its veneration of blood and cruelty, with scenes of warfare marking much of their art.[11]Most of all, duergar were concerned with practicality, peddling military saddles, thunderstones, poisons, and an extraordinarily effective form of armor lubricant. Like Gold and Shield Dwarves, duergar preferred weapons that could serve as tools on the fly, such as hammers or picks.[11]For pets and familiars, duergar often enjoyed the company of Underdark creatures, such as bats, spiders, osquips, or spitting crawlers. For beasts of burden, duergar used large lizards or steeders.[11]Unlike other dwarves, duergar had a strong tradition of magic, both in the divine and arcane varieties, and duergar clerics, runecasters, runesmiths, and wizards were highly respected for their skill.[11] Clerics were fairly common, serving the duergar gods in order to gain power and influence within society.[11]In particular, the duergar had a fondness for magically crafted items that they could use to aid them in combat, protect their minds against tampering, or to hide from enemy senses. Duergar crafted many magic items unique to them, such as absorbing shields, bolts of battering, and stonereaver axes.[11]The chief god of the duergar was Laduguer, the dwarven god of crafting, a tradition going back to the days of Clan Duergar, when the god served as the clan's divine patron. Early on, the veneration of Laduguer led to disputes with many of the other kingdoms of Shanatar, who chose to venerate Dumathoin as the patron of the entire shield dwarven race. When Clan Duergar was enslaved by the mind flayers, the duergar carried on their worship in captivity,[11] although some secretly formed pacts with the devils of the Nine Hells as well.[15]A duergar mind master.Although the duergar formally venerated all the Morndinsamman, the duergar in their captivity became only more devout in their exclusive worship of Laduguer and, later on, his adopted daughter Deep Duerra. Duerra, initially a duergar herself, was beloved among the duergar for having stolen the Invisible Art from the mind flayers during her campaign against them.[11] They didn't receive the Thunder Blessing like other dwarves and saw it as yet another sign of the Morndinsamman having abandoned them.[24] Still, a few duergar turned away from the worship of the wicked gods who ruled over the duergar such as Laduguer and Deep Duerra and found salvation through the Morndinsamman.[10]During the Spellplague, during which Laduguer and Duerra had perished, the duergar, in their desperation, turned to Asmodeus.[15]Duergar were a coarse and distrustful race who felt that other races were out to get them, whether they were from the Underdark or the surface world. In spite of this, duergar were usually willing to trade with outside races, particularly from the surface world, for the sake of profit and the relations between duergar and their sometime-enemies, sometime-friends the drow and deep gnomes were especially complicated.[11]However, the duergar had absolutely no love in their heart for their closest of kin, the shield dwarves, who the duergar felt abandoned them to the onslaught of the mind flayers. Since then, the duergar had waged war time and time again against the shield dwarves, demonstrating a deep-seated loathing.[11]Because of their pessimism, duergar rarely adventured of their own free will and were instead most commonly exiles cast out of their society. [11] Some found escape from their society through petty crime, tattooed and cast out from their cities beneath the surface and driven into the arms of other races. Their grim disposition, however, made them unlikely to form many lasting friendships.[10]The dwarves of Clan Duergar fall to the enslaving power of the Elder Brain.Initially, the duergar were a clan of shield dwarves in the dwarven kingdom of Barakuir, located within the ancient realm of Shanatar. Clan Duergar, which venerated Laduguer as their patron, was an ambitious and powerful clan, believing that they should lead the kingdoms of Shanatar themselves. When they were denied following the Second Spider War, Clan Duergar turned away from the other dwarven clans, paying only lip service to Shanatar's rulers. This proved a mistake when the mind flayers of Oryndoll, seeing the isolation of Barakuir, attacked the realm in \u22128100 DR, enslaving or killing most of the population.[11]During their captivity, which lasted for generations, the mind flayers performed many cruel and unusual experiments on the dwarves.[10] It was during this harsh period of their history that the duergar emerged as a distinct subrace.[15] Eventually, they rose up against their captors and gained their freedom from the mind flayers.[10]Now free, the duergar carved out a new home for themselves beneath the Great Glacier, founding the city of Gracklstugh in \u22123717 DR. The Deepkingdom spread rapidly through the northern reaches of the Underdark, reaching its peak in \u22122600 DR before a war with the quaggoths of Ursandunthar caused it to enter a gradual decline, battling the remnants of the nation and urged on by drow for centuries thereafter.[11]Further to the south, beneath central Faer\u00fbn, the duergar established Dunspeirrin underneath the Orsraun Mountains, which grew to encompass the caverns beneath Turmish and the Dragon Coast. Dunspeirrin reached its height of power in \u22121800 DR, when Queen Duerra defeated an alliance of drow from Undreath and the mind flayers of Oryndoll, reclaiming Deep Shanatar and Alatorin. As her divine reward, Duerra was raised to godhood by Laduguer. Afterward, however, the duergar of Dunspeirrin fell into a decline, returning to power following the Time of Troubles, only to fall into a long and arduous war with the Army of Gold.[11]A duergar stone guard.Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

Occasionally chunks of minerals, gems, or metals were set within their stony bodies.[8]Their bodies typically moved at a slow, trodding pace.[8][6]Earth elementals were not especially intelligent.[6] However, like all elementals, they instinctively resented any creature that conjured them from their home plane and bound them into its service.[8]Being elementals, these creatures did not require any air, food, drink, or sleep to survive.[8]Earth elementals were capable of gliding through stone and dirt as though it were liquid,[8] but only if they were unworked and non-magical.[1] They were also capable of precisely pinpointing the location of nearby opponents, but only if they were standing on solid ground,[8] a type of vision that was known as tremorsense.[1]Prior to the Time of Troubles, these elementals could not cross bodies of water. Thus they had to use their ability of burrowing through unworked earth to pass underneath the ground on which bodies of water stood.[6]Bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing weaponry were all ineffective against earth elementals unless they were enchanted.[1] Prior to the Time of Troubles, they could only be damaged by weapons with a +2 enchantment or greater.[6]Earth elementals would use their brute strength when fighting an opponent, slamming against them.[1][6] They were also considered to be living siege weapons, doing severe damage to objects and structures,[1] but especially those made of stone or earth.[6]These elementals could be summoned to the Prime Material plane through use of the spells elemental summoning[9] and conjure earth elemental.[10] There were also magical items that could achieve this, such as as a stone of controlling earth elementals and elemental gems.[11] It was impossible to summon an earth elemental while in the phlogiston.[12]Earth elementals rarely spoke, though when they did speak they used the Terran language.[7][1]Earth elementals were favored monsters of many deities within the Morndinsamman, acting as their divine servants. These deities included Berronar Truesilver, Clangeddin Silverbeard, Dumathoin. They were also servants of the exiled members of this pantheon, the duergar gods Deep Duerra and Laduguer.[13]In the gnome pantheon, these elementals were favored monsters of the deities Baervan Wildwanderer, Callarduran Smoothhands, Flandal Steelskin, and Segojan Earthcaller. Outside of pantheons, individual deities that favored earth elementals as divine servants included Geb, Grumbar, Rillifane Rallathil, and Sheela Peryroyl.[13]",

They were very tall, generally reaching heights of 12\u202ffeet (3.7\u202fmeters), and massive and solid, weighing 2,000\u202fpounds (910\u202fkilograms). They were well-muscled, and had red or black skin that was always burning. For this reason, many resembled devils and were often mistaken for them. Their bodies were supposedly composed of basalt, bronze, and solidified fire.[4]Efreeti magic was comparable to that of other powerful creatures, such as demons and liches, and was quite versatile. One area in which it is preeminent was in magical weaponsmithing. Efreet were particularly renowned for their ability to create flaming weapons.[citation needed]Efreet were cruel and self-serving. They all considered themselves to be of noble character and assumed grand titles to make themselves seem impressive.[citation needed]As water was to most life forms, heat was to efreet. Heat and flame sustained their bodies. For this reason, they tended to reside near fumaroles, volcanoes, and other large natural heat sources.[citation needed]Efreet also inhabited the sun of Realmspace.[9]Fire elementals avoided the efreet if they could, fearing their oppression and opportunism. Djinn hated them, and there were numerous battles between the two genie races. Dao were tolerated by the efreet, whom they traded worked materials with in exchange for raw metals. Most other races were treated by the efreet as either servants or slaves.[4]Two related concepts, however, were foremost in the mind of an efreeti: honor and acquisition.[citation needed]Efreeti names were also part of this concept. They were exceedingly long and contained history and respectful details of lineage. When interacting with lesser creatures, they would normally take on a simpler name.[citation needed]It should also be noted that mages occasionally attempted to enslave efreet in order to harness their considerable power. Such binding, while of a very different nature than that involved in the binding of demons, was equally difficult, and just as likely to result in the wrath of the bound creature, should the attempt end in its escape.[citation needed]",

In addition, there were prehistoric elephants known as mastodons and mammoths.[7]A brown-skinned short-eared species of elephant was a very common beast of riding and burden in the Utter East, namely, in the country of Doegan. The Mar people long ago learned to train and domesticate these elephants and relied on the beast for their day-to-day activities. After the Utter East's colonization by the Ffolk, most horses died off from diseases, leaving red oxen and elephants to be the dominant beasts to ride and to push carriages.[10]Elephants were sacred in the Mulhorandi pantheon. The god Anhur favored battle elephants. His fellow gods Hathor, Nephthys, and Osiris would sometimes send celestial elephants to followers in need. The deity Red Knight also considered elephants special beasts, as did Thard Harr, the dwarven jungle god.[11]In the land of Malatra, the Nubari tribe known as the Wise Ones worshiped the spirits of elephants through totems. Shamans within the tribe spoke daily with local elephants, of which there were always around eight near the edge of their village, to learn of recent events in their area. Whenever an elephant in the area got injured it would wander to the tribe in order to be healed by its shamans.[12] In the Kuong Kingdom, the creation story of the Lords of Creation held that Malatra was created in the footprints of a great elephant ridden by the goddess Indra. Naturally, the elephant was sacred to her. However, in neighboring Laothan, in Kompoa, elephants were simply slaughtered for their hides, and the Kuong believed this to be sin.[13]The Zakharan island of Afyal was called the Isle of the Elephant. Elephants there were unusually intelligent and easy to be trained, and were inviolate by law.[14] They were also connected to Afyal's former main deity, the Lost One.[15]Elephants were once common on the peninsula of Chult,[16] and images of elephants featured notably among the massive stone carvings found in the ruined temple of Nangalore.[17] As of the late 15th century DR, however, living elephants were no longer found on the peninsula.[18]Halruaan farmers bred a cattle breed of fuzzy elephants, alongside aurochs, and roth\u00e9. The creatures were allowed to graze in pastures and eventually butchered for food. Despite their meat being very gamey in flavor, they were sold during Halarahh's Monster Fairs.[19]The ivory tusks of elephants were a valued commodity in much of Faer\u00fbn[9] and in Kara-Tur; Jejima Horoto of Akkaido, Wa, imported eight tusks on a typical day in 1357 DR.[20]A fiendish elephant named Tusk was a known combatant of the Underdark coliseum of Maerimydra. This elephant belonged to Kurgoth Hellspawn.[21]",

        "description": "While most scholars of the planes considered erinyes to be among the lesser devils,[4][5][8][9][10][11] their unique position in reporting directly to the Dark Eight[9][10] meant that some considered them greater baatezu.[12][note 1][13][14][15] They shared the same rank in the infernal hierarchy as pain devils.[11]Erinyes originally appeared as imposing yet beautiful figures, so attractive that they could be easily mistaken for celestials. An erinyes generally stood around 6\u202fft (1.8\u202fm) tall, weighed approximately 150 pounds (68 kg).[3] Although they were naturally female, erinyes could appear as idealized versions of the sexes of any mortal race.[4]Their natural forms normally possessed glowing red eyes, as well as large, feathered wings that stayed regardless of the form that they took.[3][4] After Asmodeus' ascension to godhood, the erinyes lost their wings, and received hooves and fangs in return, which made them look beastly.[16]Erinyes were not only physically stunning, but dangerously capable, highly disciplined and unfailingly loyal to their lords.[1][18] When hunting mortal souls they showed both ruthlessness and cunning, exploiting their angelic appearance and tempting those they came across into committing wicked acts.[3][4]The relationship between erinyes and other devils was a conflicting combination of admiration and hatred. Having come from celestials as opposed to damned souls, erinyes viewed themselves as innately superior to other baatezu, causing a mutual disdain between them and their devil kin.[19] Other devils greatly envied the erinyes, yet at the same time, were inspired by their indomitable fury.[2][19] Feelings of lust and idolization clashed with hostility so much so that the two groups occasionally disobeyed their superiors and met one another with violence.[19]Erniyes had powerful charming abilities causing those they looked upon to obey their every whim. Their domination was so complete that the victims were willing to protect their enchantress even at the cost of their own lives and obeyed their orders without regard for the lives of others. The charm could last indefinitely, only fading upon the victim's death or if dispelled by the erinyes, although they could only use it against one individual at a time. Conversely, an erinyes could strike terror into anyone that looked upon them, causing them flee in panic.[4]Their magic helped them disguise their own presence while their truesight allowed them to see through the magical disguises of others.[3][4] When gating other devils for assistance they could call upon weaker ones such as a small group of lemures spinagons, or barbazus, or another erinyes.[1][3]Erinyes, while not the greatest warriors of Hell, possessed legendary combat prowess.[2] They were often armed with incredible swords and bows, but could expertly wield practically any weapon. Their conventional weaponry included powerful ropes of entanglement used to entrap powerful opponents and hapless victims alike. The normal battle strategy employed with the ropes was to bind their enemies before lifting them a great distance up and letting them fall.[1][3][4] They were also known to use weapons coated in caustic venom.[5]Through the brutality they inflicted on the battlefield, erinyes renewed the vigor of their allies, often engaging multiple enemies at once with unbridled rage. Despite their fearsome wrath, Erinyes were also tactically adept, coordinating with others of their kind to surround groups of enemies as opposed to merely flanking them.[2] Although erinyes had no qualms about engaging enemies on the ground, they preferred to fight from afar. They normally used their magical abilities first, sowing confusion into those below them before firing their bows.[3][4]Favored by Dispater for their beauty, skills, and unshakable allegiance, erinyes were common within Dis.[5][18] Stygia also possessed a large population of erinyes, with a whole regiment being responsible for protecting Levistus's frozen tomb was from aerial intrusion.[20] They could be found in great numbers within the political labyrinth of Maladomini, and within Grenopli specifically they acted as patrollers in order to dispel or counter offensive magic and all other attempts at violence.[21] Along with paeliryons, the seductive erinyes enjoyed a noble position and noticeable favoritism within Glasya's court, who often provided them targets for corruption to her erinyes personally, particularly those of the self-righteous faith. Hunters were known to stalk the skies of Malbolge for intruders without letters of safe passage, often capturing charismatic enemies for Glasya to torture or seduce at her leisure.[22]Even erinyes that did not work under archdevils often directly reported to the Dark Eight as opposed to having an intermediary master.[4] While some served as servants or were simply concubines, others had vastly superior tasks such as spying on both enemies and allies.[3][10] Many erinyes were responsible for bringing justice to Hell, although the method with which they did so varied greatly. Donning horned helms and stylized armor, erinyes warriors brought death to those that defied their infernal masters or the orders of Asmodeus himself.[1] As arbiters of justice, they acted on behalf of Hell and were responsible for tracking down those that broke infernal contracts.[2] Others acted on the other side of the law, helping to free mortal souls by acting as legal counsel for those that did not receive what they were promised or were forced into making their deals.[23] The role that earned erinyes the most respect among their devilish peers however, was that of the temptress.[4]Unlike almost all other devils, erinyes were capable of entering the mortal world of their own volition, and used this ability to collect mortal souls.[4] The traditional method used to achieve this goal was through seduction, although they were forced to use magic to disguise their wings if they did not attempt to use their celestial heritage as cover.[24] They entered the mortal world alone, as they were incapable of bringing others with them, and searched for mortals that they could lure back to Baator. Only one person could return to Hell with them at a time with inorganic matter being left behind, forcing the victim to try and escape Baator while dangerously underequipped or be turned into a lemure. When seducing mortals they spoke rather than communicating telepathically, and could speak a wide variety of languages.[4]When seduction was not sufficient, erinyes had other methods to enrapture mortals, such as offering Faustian bargains and other forms of deals.[24] While erinyes normally led battle-focused devils such as barbazus, merregons, or kytons, they would also command mortal warriors as some were willing to sell their souls in exchange for training.[2] As well as devils, erinyes were also occasionally put in charge of managing small cults.[25] Those that chose to take up wizardry usually studied enchantment magic to enhance their pre-existing ability to charm.[26]Erinyes could be promoted to the form of any devil above them, or be demoted into barbazus depending on their service. While they were most commonly transformed into osyluths, it was possible for them to be turned even into pit fiends.[10] In order to become pit fiends they had to undergo the same process as the gelugons and withstand the torment of the Pit of Flame for 1,001 days.[27] Despite their great maneuverability within the infernal hierarchy many turned down opportunities to be promoted, having come to enjoy their exemption from the normal ranks of the baatezu and numerous advantages.[4]Erinyes were the only types of devils to have possibly been born rather than made from mortal souls. Unlike most devils that were capable only of siring children, erinyes were capable of carrying them. It was unknown if erinyes gained the ability before or after their descent but the ability to become pregnant was another reason they often refused promotion. They were protective and cautious parents that hid colonies of their young away from the eyes of those that would interfere with their development.[19]While some reports claimed that devils could not be promoted into erinyes, others purported that the rank could serve as a reward for sluggish devils that overcame their earlier blunders despite numerous trials, such as abishai.[10] Abishai that were promoted into erinyes were said to have their features rearranged by numerous kocrachon in order to make them more appealing to mortals and somehow had syllables added to their true names to make summoning them more complicated.[27] It was rumored that only 500 erinyes were allowed to exist at one time, with lesser baatezu being promoted to fill their positions when current erinyes were promoted into higher forms.[4]Legend in the Nine Hells told that the first erinyes were angels who fell from the heavens after being corrupted by temptation or committing some misdeed.[3] Most erinyes were the descendants of fallen angels while others were their still-living ancestors having survived to become brachinas.[19]Following the ascension of Asmodeus, the erinyes received mastery over the succubi, but received a terrifying transformation.[16]Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

Ettercaps resembled hunched, grey-purplish humanoids with distended white underbellies, spider-like faces (fangs and eyes and such), and two sharp, black chitinous claws instead of hands and feet.[7]They were not particularly intelligent. They were cowardly and vicious, preferring to set traps to ensnare their enemies.[7] Much like spiders, ettercaps tended to be solitary creatures, only gathering to mate. When ettercaps did socialize, it was with monstrous spiders, which they kept as pets and guards.[citation needed]Ettercaps possessed the capability to shoot sticky webs.[7] Like spiders, they used webs as traps to capture prey, which was then injected with paralytic venom from the ettercap\u2019s bite.[citation needed]It was suggested that ettercaps were the descendants of a group of mad druids, tainted and transmogrified by their association with a powerful demon into a form resembling the predatory arachnids their cult once revered. While the vast majority had completely reverted to pure animal instinct, a rare few claimed to demonstrate the intellect and capacities of an insane human.[7]Ettercaps were very fond of spiders and other arachnids and often kept them as others kept bees. From time to time, however, an ettercap had a number of monstrous spiders as pets, which were as loyal to it as a dog to a human master.[7]Ettercaps possessed a fairly simple, spider-derived language of their own. It was focused around basic and real-world concepts, not equipped for the discussion of abstract ideas. They were capable of understanding other languages, such as elven, but could not speak them due to lacking the right vocal cords.[8]A crafting recipe for a wand of lightning found in the arcane Imaskarran Tome of Resonance included ettercap's silk gland, fenberries, and the spell of lightning bolt.[9]",

Reports of their heaviness ranged from around 1,000\u202fpounds (450\u202fkilograms) to exceeding 5,000\u202fpounds (2,300\u202fkilograms), although either way the earth shook when they ran.[8][3][6] Strangely, they were slightly lop-sided, the right side being slightly more muscular and well-developed than the left, although not enough to detract from their barbaric image.[7]In regards to their savage aspect, one of their most notable traits was their skin; if given a choice, ettins never bathed, and so their already thick skin was crusted over with a thick layer of dirty grime, giving them a horrid stench and a gray-dark brown complexion.[1][3][4] Underneath the filth, ettins had skin tone ranging from pink to brownish, with yellow-tinged hands and feet marked with callouses.[7][4]Even ignoring their unwillingness to clean themselves, ettins had no concern for their appearance and lacked any kind of grooming habits, even negative ones.[7][4] Atop their ugly heads[9] was a hanging, unkempt mess of long, stringy hair,[1][4] and inside their large, reeking mouths were crooked, yellow, and all too often rotten teeth. Notably, ettins had crude, orc-like traits in the form of a large, watery eyes, porcine snouts, and shovel jaws with lower canine teeth that protruded out like boar tusks, tusks that, for all their easiness to reach, were as revoltingly rotten as the rest of their teeth.[1][3][4]This uncleanliness extended to their sense of dress, or lack thereof; ettins wore animal skins that were uncured, unwashed, scraggly, and that were typically decaying and being eaten by moths.[7][5] The only reason they wore them was as a kind of mobile blanket, giving them something soft and warm to sleep in, and the ugly sleeping-furs normally didn't include sleeves or any unnecessary parts so as not to impede them in physically demanding tasks.[7] This wasn't to say that the idea of accessories was completely beyond them, with some keeping things like severed heads as accessories and females being known to wear jewelry as a status symbol.[7][10]Generally males were taller and heavier than females, but females, as well as having longer hair, were often fuller-bodied than the relatively gaunt and wiry males.[7][6]Aggressive, ferocious and unpredictable,[7][3] ettins were a brutish race that loved and admired power. They were natural bullies that oppressed those incapable of defending themselves, victimizing the weak through straightforward pain and intimidation.[9] It was possible that they held a traditionally \"muscle-brained\" view of the world, perceiving mental prowess and good looks as inferior to raw size and strength.[10] Despite their two heads, or perhaps as a result of their two heads, ettins were generally stupid, their two weak brains doing little to enhance their overall intelligence.[7][11]A dragonborn confusing an ettin.With that in mind, trying to take advantage of an ettins feeble mind was risky; if either head of an ettin were to see through an illusion for example, they would not stand slack-jawed and bewildered by the event but immediately and angrily conclude they were being tricked and seek out the one trying to deceive them.[7] It would also be a bad idea to assume all ettins were equally dim-witted, as the lowest of them were more akin to wild animals while the smartest members of their kind had been known to surpass the average human.[6] Ettins also weren't universally mean and destructive, the circumstances of their lives playing an important role in shaping their instinctual savagery. Some ettins were known to be curious, imaginative, humorous, and even kind, with friendly, or at the very least non-aggressive behavior, being more likely among those with comfortable lives and an ample food supply.[10][12][13][14]Ettins had a concept of value, keeping things like corpses as trophies and collecting gems, coins and art objects to ogle at.[10] They also knew the basic principles of trade, though they were suspicious of all beings, including each other, and might bargain with potential prey if more could be obtained by doing so, such as something to ensure their safety or the obtainment of more food. Generally ettins only bargained to get as much of what they wanted with the least possible risk, unbound by their deals and willing to abruptly stop discussion if it proved frustrating or annoying.[7] Despite their wariness and greed, ettins understood gratitude and had been known to take substantial risks for those who managed to earn their trust, those willing to risk their lives to help them for example.[12]It was commonly known that each head of an ettin was a distinct individual, each with their own identity, personality, memories, preferences and quirks.[1] The iconic image of the two-headed monster arguing with itself that was commonly seen in folk tales and ballads however, was of suspect accuracy.[7] On one hand, some reports found that ettins were discouraged from seriously fighting with each other. The right side of an ettin was always the strongest one meaning that the right side would always be the dominant of the relationship while the left would always be the submissive. Besides that, an ettin that lost one of its heads, assuming it survived, would be at a severe disadvantage, at least for a long period of time, so for the sake of mutual survival the two had to generally cooperate.[7][9]An ettin being assaulted by barbarians must cooperate to quarrel another day.While ettins did seem to bicker, they did so less as two hated foes and more as brattish brothers and sisters being forced to perpetually share. Serious dispute was rare in times of combat, because like selfish and squabbling siblings they were able to put aside their feuding to perform mutually beneficial actions. When this was not the case, they took constant offense towards each other and fought to assert themselves in their never-ending sibling rivalry.[1][9] Part of this contempt for one another seemed to be a result of familiarity, as the two were conjoined from birth and so could only rarely appreciate privacy and solitude when the other was asleep.[1]Aside from great strength and a thick hide, ettins were relatively simple in terms of their abilities, little more than bigger ogres with the exception of their two heads.[4] An ettin's heads granted it protection against mental controlling spells, and unless the spell affected more than one individual, only one head would fall victim to it. The other head, meanwhile, would remain active, although the arm opposite to them might be limp and useless depending on the effect the other head was being subject to, allowing that side to be disarmed easily.[7] Ettins themselves only rarely had the mental fortitude required to cast spells, although some were known to have sorcerous powers.[14][15]An ettin's two heads contributed to its keen senses, including their excellent infravision. Though ettins could see in light and weren't impaired by it, they disliked and avoided sunlight and other strong sources of brightness like continual light spells (torches or regular light spells were too weak to affect them this way). This great distaste was caused by a combination of instinct, conditioning and self-preservation; they were likely to be left alone in dark and hidden places and it was more dangerous for them when it was bright out. Their sense of smell was also sharp enough that they could distinguish between animals and civilized beings, unusual and familiar surroundings and identify specifics purely through olfactory means.[7] Combined with the fact that one head was almost always alert while they were sleeping, and it made ettins a difficult race to surprise.[1]In many legends regarding ettins, it was said they, similarly to hydras, could regrow their lost heads, and while this wasn't true it was unclear whether or not an ettin could survive with a head missing.[7][9] On one hand it would seem that it would be impossible as the jugular vein would have to be cut, but then again chimeras could survive when one of their heads were removed. It was said that ettins possible had some kind of instinctive muscular or biological reaction to having a head removed that rerouted blood vessels and nerves to go to the other head.[7][16]Regardless, an ettin with its head removed, assuming it survived, would be at a serious disadvantage, losing all unique benefits of having two heads. Losing the lesser head simply forced the dominant to take full control, although the loss of the dominant head left the remaining head wildly and clumsily flailing the other side of their body. It would take two months to learn perfect control after such an event and a one-headed ettin would be looked down on by others as deformed, although given that they already didn't care about one another's opinions this was a minor detriment.[7][16]An ettin attacking.Ettins proved dangerous opponents capable of surprising acts of unity when in combat, their two heads being more useful than they might first appear. Because ettins had two heads, their bodies were driven to move twice as fast as a similar creature with only one head,[9] the left and right arms able to act independently without issue.[4] Despite their size and idiocy, the long-armed ettins also had the advantage of being able to strike shorter opponents like gnomes without particular difficulty, as one head was always alert.[8][17]Though they had a tendency to attack on sight[8] and often kept fighting until all their opponents were dead, not being ones to retreat too easily, they weren't overly careless, above fleeing when victory seemed impossible, and didn't engage obviously superior opposition when they could simply run.[4][7] Some of the more intelligent ettins were known to learn how to cast spells, some as bards and others as shamans, and given the proper training one head could cast spells while the other attacked as easily as both could swing their weapons.[11][15][18]Fortunately for everyone besides them, ettins generally lacked the intelligence to make full use of their advantages, although their stupidity was counteracted by their primitive cunning and crude sense of tactics. Ettins were ambush hunters who would rather jump weak victims then get into a straightforward fight,[3][4][7] more capable of short bursts of great strength than protracted melee.[14] They hunted at night to take advantage of their superior senses and avoid being attacked by diurnal adversaries, and any idea of honor or truces in combat was alien to them.[7]Despite their ruthlessness, ettins weren't too deadly if confronted properly, a basically competent band of warriors with decent armaments being able to lay them low with relative simplicity.[8] Their generally immorality meant that the crueler ettins could be lured into traps with the terrified screams of a potential victim.[9] If the heads were somehow turned against each other, an ettin could be made into its own worst enemy as it visibly attempted to restrain and batter itself into submission.[19] The two-headed giants neither possessed nor desired finesse, a sign of their attacks being the destroyed structures and toiled earth left in the aftermath of their clumsy smashing. Bestial, slobbery howls of pain and frustration could be heard when they were when evaded by nimble enemies[7][9] and when flanked resorted to swatting the pests away.[2]They greatly preferred fighting in melee, favoring weapons that crushed and battered like spiked clubs and iron bars, and even without weapons they could still try to improvise, unhesitatingly uprooting trees or breaking furniture to use them as weapons. Failing that, they would pulverize their opponents with their fists, but if no other option presented itself they could utilize the typical giant method for besting ranged opponents; throwing rocks.[4][7] Ettins would also make use of more advanced weaponry like battleaxes, morningstars, or javelins, as well as don armor to protect themselves.[1][3]Already without privacy or isolation throughout all of their lives, ettins violently sought solitude, crushing any trespassers in their domains without question nor warning. The last thing most ettins wanted was another individual to deal with, much less another member of their kind, as a shouting match between four pugnacious primitives was even more intolerable than the ordinary state of affairs.[1][3][4] Only rarely would they gather together into small groups, as gangs of living mates or bands of wandering destroyers, if an ettin of particular power, intelligence, or strength of will presented itself. These groups, anywhere between a 2-5 in numbers, cooperated with one another only so long as there was some perceivable benefit in doing so and if the leader stayed alive and undefeated. The death, departure or discrediting of that leader, or really any major loss suffered, was often enough to shatter group cohesion and break up the band.[9][3][4][7]Despite placing little value in currency outside of its aesthetics, ettins collected it regardless because other, lesser creatures found it desirable.[3][4][7]Befitting their hermit lifestyle, the typical ettin shunning of company did not exclude them from keeping certain animals as pets, though such animals were generally dangerous and self-sufficient. Animals like bears, including owlbears, and creatures like wyverns were known to be found with ettins,[2][3][4][20] and they sometimes existed in symbiosis with the similarly solitary otyughs.[21] Ettins were rather similar to their companions in terms of behavior, their \"society\" producing little of value and their lifestyles being akin to those of ogres.[9][4]Ettins were also known to use the currency they collected to supply goblins or orcs with treasure. Through this an ettin could, in addition to making them tolerate the ettin's nearby presence, compel them to build it a wall or trap or to fight along side them.[3][4][7] Orcs in particular, likely because of the visual similarities between the two, treated the ettins as distant cousins, bribing the creatures into tenuous alliances with food, treasure and promises of plunder in exchange for their services as scouts, marauders and guardians.[1]Even if not approached, ettins might come to other humanoids seeking to sell themselves as watchmen and protectors,[13] and they sometimes worked under the more powerful hill, frost and fire giants.[3][22][23] On the other hand, some ettins tried to carve out savage fiefdoms where they would be brought tribute by their bullied subjects.[9]Females were the dominant gender among ettins, responsible for initiating their crude courtship rites. They wore treasures taken from prey to signify their hunting ability, and thus increase their attractiveness in the eyes of males, and gave such items to males as gifts to woo them. Otherwise, courting among ettins boiled down to a female hunting down a male and subduing them in a show of dominance, after which the male stayed around and cared for the female.[7][12]Under normal circumstances ettins had no native language nor were they particularly fluent in any specific language. Instead, they spoke a pidgin of goblin, orc, giant, Common, and Abyssal, picking up smatterings of other cultures' words and expressions based on the predominant speech around them. It wasn't particularly difficult to decipher this twisted tongue if one knew the languages that comprised it,[7][3][4] and ettins themselves had no difficulty interpreting each other through their grunts, growls, and throat clearings mixed with speech.[3][8]Most ettins knew at least a little bit of Abyssal, often considering it their language, but in some places of the world, ettin populations that established themselves over a long period of time managed to develop their own degenerate dialect of orcish, a language that could truly be called their own.[7]Ettins were typically referred to using compound names applying to the whole individual and parts of those names to refer to individual heads. The first syllable or two referred to the first head and the latter half of the name to the second, and both were referred to by the combined name.[1]The chosen god of the ettins was Grolantor, but rarely did they make any sacrifices or other religious gestures towards him as they didn't truly worship him. Ettins merely revered Grolantor, paying him homage not as a deity but as an ettin of great strength, size, knowledge, and wisdom, whose eternal vigilance protected them from those who would dominate or destroy them.[7][16] This two-headed aspect, which granted, Grolantor was known to take on at times as an avatar, was referred to as Grolettinor or Grelinor.[24][16][7] Not only did they not worship Grolantor as a god, but they had been known to give similar reverence to ettins with supernatural powers.[15] Grolantor was a stupid and willfully ignorant deity whose pride outmatched his good sense,[24] which combined with the ettin's attitude towards him led him to not grant them spells, although very rarely ettins would become his shamans and possess weak divine powers caused by their faith in him.[7][16]Thrarak, ettin exarch of the Aameul half of Demogorgon.However, ettins not being a historically inclined race, were known to have various religious habits based on the legends that made their way to them. The two-headed Prince of Demons, the legendary Demogorgon, was credited for the creation of the ettins in many tales and those ettins who believed these stories often regarded him as the father of their race.[1][9] Demogorgon was a paragon of power and so ettins favored being associated with him, the claim of being chosen by him greatly increasing an ettin's status among its peers.[12][9] Those ettins who worshiped Demogorgon also worshiped other demons, believing them to be closer kin than other giants, and demon-worshiping ettins were even more savage and cruel than the normal variety, many of them being either demonically possessed or driven mad by abyssal energy.[9]Ettin shamans talked to spirits, laid curses, and inspired their kin with wrathful chants, making their enemies vulnerable to attack while empowering and enraging their allies to destroy them.[9][2]Ettins established themselves in rocky and remote regions like untamed borderlands, forested mountains, hillsides and valleys.[2][3] They preferred cold areas somewhere between subarctic and temperate temperatures, and typically dwelt underground in caverns or abandoned mines.[4][7]Ettin lairs were truly disgusting places, their clothes and personal belongings a haven for vermin and parasitic disease.[4][7]Ettins were a primarily carnivorous race that lived off a diet of raw flesh that they'd often tenderize or smash to a pulp against rocks before consuming it.[7] They ate any living thing they could catch,[4] including the bones; each head had a voracious appetite to match a troll's and the monsters as a whole required four times as much food as humans.[9][6] No creature was above moral reproach when it came to consumption, and they would hunt even other ettins if they were vulnerable, although normally they only resorted to cannibalism if starving or badly wounded while no other food supply nearby.[7][9]Given that they shared the same lower region, it was no surprise that the heads of an ettin shared the same gender.[1] A female ettin's pregnancy lasted somewhere between 6-7 months, and once the child was born the conquered male was free to leave, although despite their low level of tolerance for each other the males typically stayed around until the child became self-sufficient.[1][3][4][7]Six months after being born, an ettin child was about 5\u202fft (1.5\u202fm) tall and somewhat capable of self-defense, and after somewhere between eight months to a year they could be considered mature. At this age they were capable of hunting for themselves, after which the young adult was either sent away by the parents to fend or itself, leaving whatever area they were using as a den abandoned, or, if the ettins were part of a group, the ettin was just considered as another member.[1][3][4][7] Despite the divine blood of Annam coursing through their veins, their blood was so diluted that most only lived for about 75 years.[3][6]A biclops had two eyes, but not as a set.Twice the regeneration.Ettins had been known to crossbreed with other races of giants, producing strange variants such as two-headed fire giants.[25] More commonly seen were giant-kin mongrels, such as two-headed trolls, and the existence of two-headed ogres raised the likelihood that they could breed with them too.[26][27] Perhaps strangest of all, or at the least the strangest looking, were the biclopses, ettin/cyclopskin hybrids next to which even the ettins seemed civilized and intelligent.[28]If one of an ettin's minds was forced into a body with only one head they would ironically be only half as efficient, as they were inexperienced in controlling such a form. Ironically, average minds were more likely to be able to take control of an ettin's body than an original member of the conjoined duo, a result of their greater intelligence. Two minds controlling an ettin's body were capable of effective action so long as there was verbal communication between the two.[29] If someone was polymorphed into an ettin, there was a chance that over time they would develop a split personality as different aspects of their being were split in two.[19]An ettin werewolf.Ettins were known to be susceptible to various forms of lycanthropy, including the forms of wererats, wereboars, and werewolves. When transformed into the intermediate \"hybrid form\" both of an ettin's heads were retained and transformed into the associated beast, though there was a 10% chance that only one of the two heads would be affected. Unlike other giants afflicted with lycanthropy, ettins were incapable of transforming into a full animal form and scholars speculated that this was due to their having two heads.[30]Arno and Julian, progenitor of the ettins.The ancestors of the ettins were Annam's weakest mortal sons, Arno and Julian, the two-headed runt of the All-Father's litter.[31]Although technically true giants related to Annam, ettins were relatively small, often grouped together with giant-kin, and were never granted a portion land by Annam from which to found their own \"dynasty\" inside the kingdom of Ostoria.[31][32] However, they still had a role in Ostoria's ancient society, tending to gardens with pools that would reflect the face of someone gazing at another pool.[32]Given the relative unimportance of the ettins, it was no wonder that the true history of the race was shrouded in myth and legend. Their cultural and religious background led many to conclude that at one point ettins and hill giants came from the same original stock, and while the accuracy of such claims was at the very least shaky, the influence of Grolantor on both raised the possibility that there was a kernel of truth.[6][7]Grolantor was considered a runt among the giant gods, and was often accused of collecting and interbreeding the runts of other giant breeds, even polluting them himself by producing offspring with medusa-like hags and earth-bound, serpentine monstrosities. One myth purported he was the father of the ettin race, having produced them by mating with a monstrous snake with heads at either end of her coiled body.[6][7][24]Their seemed to be some relation between ettins and cyclopes.[33] Both that and the obvious orcish traits of the ettins could also be explained by Grolantor's degenerate mirroring of his father, but it was likely that the exact racial background of the modern ettins would never be known.[6][7][24]Others explained the ettins' orcish ties by appealing to Demogorgon, some legends stating that upon stumbling into a temple of the Prince of Demons, a group of orcs were twisted into near-mad mockeries of his form, turning them into the first ettins.[1] Different legends proposed another, Demogorgon-related creation myth, although one that didn't explain their orcish appearance. Supposedly, after Demogorgon was split in two by the god Amoth during the Dawn War, a primordial of stone and earth known as Storralk quickly attempted to descend upon the weakened demon lord, attempting to use the opportunity to claim the title of Prince of Demons for himself.[2][9]Even in this weakened state however, Demogorgon was able to rip Storralk to pieces in a battle that sent shock waves through the Abyss and Astral Sea. By the end, Demogorgon was still so filled with wrath that he used a powerful ritual just to further draw out Storralk's suffering, a rite given to him by Dagon which allowed him to gaze into the pools of Storralk's blood and cause his own twin-headed reflections to arise out of it. All ettins were bound to Storralk and his flayed corpse was kept imprisoned beneath Demogorgon's throne. Demogorgon sent the ettins out into the Elemental Chaos knowing that every time an ettin felt pain, the opportunistic primordial's corpse would quiver in agony.[2][9]True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

They were capable of speaking Ignan although they rarely spoke.[3]Being elementals, these creatures did not require any air, food, drink, or sleep to survive.[7]Besides fire, these elementals had ichor flowing through their bodies, which could be used as a magical ingredient.[8]Fire elementals usually chose to burn opponents with their touch. They attacked ferociously, enjoying burning things in the material plane to cinders. The fire elemental might also slam an opponent, possibly causing them to catch fire.[3]The fire elemental Jogaoh was forcibly transported from his home plane to the world of Toril by the extraplanar being Imgig Zu. Employing a Lockstone, Imgig Zu then trapped the powerful fire elemental in the form of a weak dwarf, which in turn bound him to Toril. In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Vajra Valmeyjar and Priam Agrivar brought Jogaoh to the Lockstone, and the magical gem restored him to his true form. Jogaoh returned to his own plane.[9]A fire elemental emerged from the Great Door outside Waterdeep later in 1357 DR. Advised by his assistant Dunstanny, the wizard Parwyyd Hanifar used the elemental as a fire source for a pyrotechnics spell, causing fireworks that dazzled gargoyles and kenkus that also emerged from the Door.[10]These elementals could be summoned to the Prime Material plane through use of the spells elemental summoning[11] and conjure fire elemental.[12] There were also magical items that could achieve this, such as a brazier of commanding fire elementals, elemental gems,[13] and a fire elemental gem.[14]Such creatures could be summoned to fight on one's side by casting the conjure fire elemental spell or by using a fire elemental gem.[14]They were considered favored monsters, and therefore often used as divine servants, by the following deities: Dumathoin, Flandal Steelskin, Gaerdal Ironhand, Gorm Gulthyn, or Kossuth.[15]They were often harnessed by fire giants as guardians for their strongholds.[16]",

        "description": "Fire giants had very broad bodies, making them sort of dwarf-like in appearance, and bulky.[6][8] They stood roughly 18\u202ffeet (5.5\u202fmeters) tall,[7][13][16] but they weighed over 7,000\u202fpounds (3,200\u202fkilograms),[6][7] much heavier than a human of that height would weigh.[note 1] Their skin was very dark, reminiscent of coal, and the color of their hair tended towards a spectrum of flaming orange or red,[6][8] with similarly colored red eyes.[8]Their clothing was usually flame-colored or black and singed. They also tended to wear armor that was forged from steel[6] or dragonscales.[8]Fire giants often considered bravery as being one of the highest virtues anyone could and should have.[17] They relished opportunities in which they could test their fortitude against formidable opponents.[4]Much like all giants, a fire giant could see and hear twice as far as the average human. Unique to their race were senses well adapted to high temperature environments. Their eyes in particular were capable of seeing through the hazes and shimmers often associated with such temperatures.[18]Although their bodies were impervious to harm from fire, even that exhaled by a red dragon,[8] some fire giants were particularly vulnerable to cold.[6]Fire giants possessed an average affinity for runecasting as well as traditional sorcery. This affinity was superior to many of their kin, but paled in comparison to that of cloud and storm giants.[19] They typically preferred to memorize spells that would help them in detecting and thwarting intruders.[20]Fire giants were known to attack their enemies with rocks heated in fire or lava, thereby softening the targets before engaging in close quarters combat.[6] When it came to close quarters, fire giants favored the use of large swords,[8] typically enchanted with flames.[6]Having had caltrops used against them one too many times, innovative fire giants developed boots made of either iron or dragonskin to protect their feet. These were typically covered in either fur or leather in order to conceal the material from any crafty magic user that might think to use spells of cold or heat. It was rumored that some giants had become specialists in fighting with these boots.[21]The fire giant race began with an individual by the name of Masud, one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea, who in the kingdom of Ostoria was ceded control of the southern volcanoes.[22] They managed to tame such chaotic environs, building cities of adamantine and mithral.[23] Within this mighty kingdom they acted as its craftsmen, engineers, and military officers.[15] Their craftsmen created some of the kingdom's greatest works of craftsmanship.[24]Fire giants lived in small family groups, called huslyder.[18]They preferred to dwell in hot environments like volcanic areas, either in caverns or castles, and existed in societies often led by a king or a queen.[6]Fire giants were known to speak the general giant language Jotun, their own specialized version of it known as Jotunild, as well as common.[12] However, they were often largely illiterate due to education being undervalued in their culture.[25]Common given names among fire giants included the following:[26]Like all giants, they were generally known to worship Annam All-Father and those that did viewed their lives as being one long opportunity to emulate him.[27] However, by the late-15th century DR their views regarding Annam turned sour and very few directly worshiped him anymore. The deity primarily worshiped by fire giants, especially after the late 15th century, was Annam's son Surtur.[28] Though some were also known to worship the giant goddess Hiatea.[29]Beyond the giant pantheon, many were known to worship to a lesser extent elemental fire,[30] and by extension Kossuth,[31] which they would show their devotion to by performing ritually performing complex and intricate dances along the edges of vast firepits and streams of lava. Tribes would sometimes invite visitors to join them in their dance, but the steam and heat involved often led other races to hallucinate and experience effects similar to that of the spell phantasmal killer.[30]Priests often held a role of leadership in fire giant communities, positions such as architect of forger. If such a position was not held then they were typically charged with making sure others in their tribe remained productive. This was largely achieved by composing inspiring tales that lauded the features of Gudheim, the crystal palace of Annam.[32]Many fire giants, at least in the Ice Spires region, were known to enslave fomorians and verbeegs, as well as occasionally dwarves and gnomes. Slaves held the lowest role in their societal structures and were often treated with little dignity.[32] They typically worked as laborers in their forges and strongholds.[4]Fire Giants were often hostage takers and took payments from less powerful creatures in their surrounding area in exchange for not attacking them.[6]They were known to occasionally forge alliances with, and even serve, red dragons.[33] They were also known to domesticate hell hounds, keeping them as pets or guards.[4][8]True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again. If the golem takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

        "description": "Flesh golems were put together from the body parts of several different creatures, usually human, all stitched and bolted into a new and gruesome humanoid form. Bigger than a living man, it was 8 feet (2.4 meters) tall and about 500 pounds (230 kilograms) in weight. As the flesh was often robbed from graves and still decaying, it had a lingering slight smell of dead flesh and fresh turned soil, and no ordinary animal would willingly follow its trail. Unable to fully control its body, a flesh golem moved and walked stiffly. It was also unable to speak, being only able to make a hoarse roar. Its clothing and possessions were whatever its creator wished to give it, often just a tattered pair of trousers and no weapons.[3]One of Damien Morienus' flesh golems.Flesh golems were constructed using the physical body parts of once-living creatures. These had to be collected from at least six different corpses: one each for the torso, head (including the brain), arms and legs, though sometimes more bodies were needed. The corpses must be human, not too badly decayed, and otherwise normal. Special unguents and bindings were needed to keep the flesh bound together during creation; these alone cost 500 gold pieces. Actually putting the body together required skills in medicine, surgery, or leatherworking.[3]The spells animate dead, bull's strength, geas/quest, and limited wish by a capable spellcaster were used in the creation of a flesh golem. The total monetary cost of its construction was around 10,500 gold pieces.[3]A complete flesh golem was valued at 20,000 gp.[3]Despite their strength and durability, flesh golems tended to be ineffective in combat, owing to their lack of defense, particular if their opponents had no adamantine weapons, though they could handily smash those without. Those who used them paired them with a source of electricity to heal them.[3]Moreover, a flesh golem engaged in battle could well go berserk, as its elemental spirit escaped and left it uncontrolled. There was a small but increasingly risk of this happening the longer a fight went on. The rampaging flesh golem would attack the closest living creature, and, if no creature was in reach, smash any object that was smaller than it, before moving on to find something else. To regain control, the creator of the flesh golem must approach within 60\u202ffeet (18\u202fmeters) and firmly persuade it to stop for at least a minute.[3]A flesh golem, like other similar constructs, was immune to any spell that could be resisted. Other magical effects affected them differently to living creatures. Magical fire and cold not only damaged flesh golems but also slowed them down, from a dozen seconds to over a minute. Magical electrical discharges actually healed a damaged flesh golem and undid any slowing effect, and if they were not damaged, they would actually become more durable temporarily.[3]Their toughness means they require adamantine weapons to effectively damage them.[3]",

They could grow up to 6\u202fft (1.8\u202fm) long, and weigh up to 250\u202flb (110\u202fkg). The tongues of these beasts could grow up to 18\u202fft (5.5\u202fm) long.[3]All species of giant frog held a great fear towards fire and would try to get as far away from it as they could.[3][4]Due to their extended size, a giant frog could jump up to 10\u202fft (3\u202fm) high,[1][3] and across gaps that were 20\u202fft (6.1\u202fm) wide, even from being completely stationary.[1] In earlier ages, some scholars noted specimens that could jump even greater heights, up to 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm).[4]These monstrous frogs were well camouflaged, so it was likely that their prey would be surprised. They would use their large adhesive tongues to capture and restrain foes.[3]In combat, these beasts bit their foes, and usually grappled them in the process. Small creatures were often swallowed whole after being restrained by the frog's bite, causing the internal acids to wear away at it.[1]Ruke Diggot suffered the fate of being swallowed whole by one of these hulking amphibians.[5]Giant frogs formed packs, although they didn't have a sophisticated hierarchy.[3]A giant frog devours a humanoid.These creatures mostly ate insects, small creatures, and fish,[3] as well as birds and rats.[4]They were also capable of devouring other large creatures whole, including humans,[4][5] halflings, and elves.[4]Giant frogs were found in almost all natural areas of fresh water \u2014 lakes, rivers, marshes, and swamps.[4]They were known to inhabit many places all around Faer\u00fbn, including the Mere of Dead Men,[8] the Vast Swamp,[9] the Mortick Swamp,[10] Phlan,[11] the Nagaflow[12], and in the Underdark, particularly Undermountain.[13]Outside of Faer\u00fbn, giant frogs were known to be found in many of the tropical forests and swamps of Maztica.[14]Large aquatic creatures, such as giant species of fish, giant turtles,[4][3] and Giant snakes were often known to prey upon them. Although giant frogs hunted very frequently, they knew their boundaries and place in the food chain, thus they did their best to avoid such predators.[4]Some giant frogs were known to keep the company of bullywugs. Bullywugs, as they were able to communicate with frogs and toads, formed bonds with these large frogs. Bullywugs trained the frogs to be protectors that could also hunt food for them. The ability of these frogs to swallow their prey whole allowed for the bullywugs to transport their future meals back to camp simply and efficiently.[15]In the Flooded Forest, there were rumors of giant frogs forming druidic circles and being capable of casting spells.[16]",

Likewise, their eyes were generally shades of blue or yellow.[4][5][6][11] Men often grew beards, which would become matted with frost and icicles.[11]Frost giants typically wore the skins or pelts of animals, along with any jewelry they owned.[14] In terms of armor they tended to favor chainmail and helmets that were adorned with horns or feathers.[5]Frost giants had a reputation among other races for being crude and of low intelligence, but they were very cunning fighters.[5] They greatly respected brute strength and battle prowess.[11]Much like all giants, a frost giant could see and hear twice as far as the average human. Unique to their race were senses well adapted to low temperature environments. Their visual senses extended into a higher end of the visible spectrum, allowing them to see more easily through snow and blizzards than other creatures.[16]Although their bodies were impervious to harm from cold, even that breathed by a white dragon,[6] they were particularly vulnerable to fire.[14]Frost giant shamans were generally capable of casting spells from either the Charm, Divination, Healing, Protection, or Weather spheres.[5] While their clerics generally had access to any two of the following domains \u2014 Chaos, Destruction, Evil, or War. With Destruction and War being the most common.[4]Their witch doctors were known to favor the spells deeppockets, detect magic, ESP, invisibility, mirror image, shocking grasp, unseen servant, and ventriloquism.[5]Frost giants were known to be susceptible to two forms of lycanthropy, werebear and seawolf, and were one of only two giant races in which \"true\" lycanthropes were known to occur. These true lycanthropes were a form of polar werebear \u2014 they appeared hairier than the average frost giant and were incapable of assuming a \"hybrid form.\"[17]Those afflicted with the polarwere condition were known to occasionally live among other frost giants, but generally they were loners as their pelts were considered highly coveted among their kin.[17]Frost giants would often try to ambush their enemies by hiding within snow atop icy or snowy slopes, elevations that would be too high for most smaller creatures to reach.[5] Frost giants often engaged their opponents by first hurling large boulders at them from afar, then closing in with some form of weapon.[5][14]Typical frost giant weapons included battleaxes,[5][14] greataxes,[1][3] and various weapons similar to those wielded by barbarians of the North.[6] Some were known to fight with giant bolas \u2014 a weapon originally developed by jungle giants, frost giants had personalized it by using massive blocks of ice in place of wooden balls.[18] Other frost giants repurposed the armor and weaponry of their smaller foes, such as stringing many shields together into a makeshift scale armor or using their swords as heads for giant-sized spears.[11]The frost giant race began with an individual by the name of Ottar, one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea, who in the kingdom of Ostoria was ceded control of the northern tundras.[19] Within this mighty kingdom they acted as its defenders on every frontier.[20] During this time they were also known for creating sculptures out of ice and snow that, through melting and freezing, would change shape to form scenes of their life in the North.[21]For frost giants an individual's place in the ordning was determined by evidence of physical might,[11] often taking the form of a combination of the individual's ability to wrestle and boast.[22] Though it could also take the form of musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of their enemies.[11] It was not uncommon for them to try proving their strength and improving their status by challenging a white dragon.[23] Because of this violent way of life, most frost giants died in battle rather than passing away peacefully.[8]Whenever frost giants of different clans met and their status was unclear, they would wrestle for dominance. At times this could resemble a festival, with giants cheering on their clan's champions and making bold boasts or challenges, but at other times it could take the form of a chaotic free-for-all.[11]In their societies, the most important bond (besides that of the ordning) was that of family.[16] So much so that the recitation of ancestral lineage was an important aspect of the sagas crafted by their skalds, with each new character being introduced with a full recitation accompanied by appropriate music.[24]A frost giant jarl, as depicted in Epic Stat Cards.Due to the environments in which they typically lived, frost giants had a largely carnivorous diet. Frost giants typically obtained their food by means of hunting or raiding the settlements of humans and demihumans,[5] although they were not below trading if the need arose.[28] Some kept livestock that they had obtained from raids. When hunting in their native tundras, it was not uncommon for a frost giant to forgoe cooking a fresh kill, as it would taste sufficiently hot to their tastes.[11]Frost giants typically lived in either castles or mountainous caverns.[14]Frost giants inhabited frigid, mountainous[14] or arctic regions where heavy snowfall was common.[5]Beyond the Prime Material plane, large communities of frost giants lived on the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice[29] and small tribes of them could be found in Stygia.[30]Frost giants were known to speak the general giant language Jotun, their own specialized version of it known as Jotunise, as well as common.[9] However, they were often largely illiterate due to education being undervalued in their culture.[31]Common given names among frost giants included the following:[32]The role of religious leadership in frost giant communities was held by shamans and extremely rarely a witch doctor.[5][33] Though in the latter case, such a community was centered around an unusual cult instead of the Giant pantheon, as those gods were not served by witch doctors.[34]Frost giants often captured and tamed wild animals, keeping them as pets, guards, or hunting companions. The most typical animal they kept was winter wolves,[5][6][35] followed by owlbears,[36] mammoths, and remorhazes.[3] With rarer creatures including yetis and even white dragons.[5]Some were known to kidnap individuals and then either enslave them or hold them for ransom.[5]Frost giants were sometimes hired by cloud giants to plunder art and wealth on their behalf.[37]True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

        "description": "Gargoyles appeared to be winged statues of demon-like humanoids. These creatures had mastered the ability to stand motionless for long periods of time, which added to the fa\u00e7ade of their statue-like appearance.[citation needed]Their original nature aided them in that they are adept at appearing perfectly still, as if they are still made of stone, and their hides were rough and thick, similar to stone as well. They favored surprising their opponents, either by moving suddenly from their motionless state or by suddenly swooping down on their prey from a height.[citation needed]Gargoyles were ferocious creatures, often attacking any creature they detected, and loved to inflict pain. They would torture any victims they could hold helpless,[5] going so far as eating them alive just to hear their screams even though they required no food to survive, but much prefer intelligent races over anything else.[citation needed]Gargoyles particularly enjoyed shiny objects containing gemstones and precious metals.[citation needed]Kapoacinths were gargoyles that lived underwater; their wings were used to aid in their swimming. Other than their habitat, they were the same as their land-dwelling kin, preferring shallow waters and undersea caves.[citation needed] Kapoacinths were known for loving torture, and a number of them lived in lairs beneath the city of Ascarle near the Purple Rocks.[7]Even more vicious than normal gargoyles, margoyles preferred living underground and were sometimes found leading a group of normal gargoyles. Their skin was much harder and they were more difficult to spot against stone.[8]Also known as greater gargoyles or true gargoyles, grists resembled constructs more than they did magical beasts. They were created by casting wish, stone shape, polymorph any object, fly and geas/quest on a statue resembling a gargoyle. Grists were only semi-intelligent and could only understand simple instructions, though they would follow these instructions to the letter. The spells used to create them make them incredibly resistant to damage and unlike their less magical kin, it was impossible to determine whether they were alive or not without magical aid. Their ability to fly came from the magic used to create them, but their wings improved their maneuverability in the air. They had no vocal cords so they could not speak, they could not reproduce their species, and they could not grow, remaining at the same height throughout their lives. They occasionally ate gemstones and coins that they found on their opponents' bodies but, like other gargoyles, they did not need to eat.[citation needed]Allegedly, gargoyles were all originally made of stone, artistic monuments placed on buildings to help prevent the erosion of the walls of stone buildings by deflecting rainwater. At some point, an unknown mage gave life to these monuments, who became the monsters that once stalked Faer\u00fbn.[citation needed]Four gargoyles served Imgig Zu, defending his tower north of Waterdeep in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR. They attacked a City Guard patrol that investigated the tower.[9] Later, they snatched up Cybriana, Priam Agrivar, Vajra Valmeyjar, Timoth Eyesbright, and Onyx the Invincible, carrying them into the tower, but were slain.[10]A number of gargoyles, alongside flying kenkus, were attendants to the one who waits in the Nine Hells. Later in 1357 DR, when the Great Door appeared in the Hells, the gargoyles and kenkus flew through and emerged first in the skies over Waterdeep. They were met in battle by Vajra Valmeyjar and Timoth Eyesbright, before the City Guard and Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun arrived to defend the city. Later, when the exit of the gate was restored to its location in a pit outside the city, the same flying creatures assaulted Parwyyd Hanifar, Dunstanny, Onyx the Invincible, and Cybriana, before they ended the threat of the Great Door and the one who waits.[11]A tribe of gargoyles was known as a \"nastiness\", the plural of which was \"nastinesses\".[12]Gargoyles could often be found lairing underground or in ruins with small groups of their kind.[5] They were also known to be found perched on tall buildings, where their appearance would be hidden among other statues of non-living gargoyles, thus allowing them to hide in plain sight.[citation needed]In the Abyss, gargoyles guarded the gates of Ungorth Reddik, Demogorgon's fortress that rose from the fetid bogs of the Gaping Maw.[13]Sometimes gargoyles worked for evil masters[5] in exchange for some small amount of treasure, though their primary payment was the opportunity to attack intruders.[citation needed]Gargoyle horns were often used as an ingredient in the brewing of potions of invulnerability and potions of flying.[4]",

        "description": "This is a\nGood Article!Typically, a gelatinous cube measured between 10 to 15\u202ffeet (3 to 4.6\u202fmeters) on a side and weighed as much as 50,000\u202fpounds (23,000\u202fkilograms),[4][3] although legends existed of much larger cubes.[3] The creature was completely transparent, with only a glint of its surface in the light to give away its position.[4][5] The occasional random object floating in a well fed gelatinous cube's body could also serve as a warning of its presence to dungeon delvers.[1]Gelatinous cube bodies were remarkably moldable. They could flow around objects and through narrow passages, quickly returning to their shapes once enough space was available.[6]A gelatinous cube was a mindless predator that silently roamed ancient crypts and vaults in regular, predictable patterns.[1] As they traveled the halls of old ruins, they absorbed any material in their paths from the floors and walls.[2] Although incapable of climbing walls, particularly large gelatinous cubes could also absorb mold and moss from ceilings.[4] Organic material was quickly dissolved in the acidic ooze that made up the cube's body, while bones and inorganic matter spent some time floating within the creature until eventually expelled.[1][5][6] As they slid through the corridors, they left behind a perfectly clean path,[1] except for an occasional slimy trail.[4]Gelatinous cubes could not see or hear, but were capable of sensing vibrations and were attracted to warmth.[6]A gelatinous cube engulfing an adventurer.When facing an opponent, a gelatinous cube could slam it with an acidic pseudopod or attempt to engulf it.[1] It was possible, although difficult, for sufficiently strong creatures to escape engulfment by a gelatinous cube.[3] Despite their slow speed, gelatinous cubes were strong and could easily push back and knock over even large creatures.[3]When touching a creature, gelatinous cubes secreted a gummy paralyzing substance that was immediately absorbed through the skin into the victim's bloodstream. After successfully engulfing a victim, the cube moved pockets of an acidic digestive substance towards the victim's body, quickly digesting it.[1][5][6] Survivors of gelatinous cube attacks displayed scars that resembled partially melted wax.[6]Regardless of their sizes and homogeneous composition, gelatinous cubes were vulnerable to most usual forms of attack,[1][5] although reports existed of cubes that were immune to electricity.[4] Mind-altering effects were useless against the mindless creatures.[1][3][5] Some were said to be slowed down by cold-based spells.[5]Gelatinous cubes were omnivorous[4] scavengers.[5]Despite being extremely effective against flesh and cellulose, the digestive fluid of gelatinous cubes had no effect on inorganic matter or bones.[1][5][6] Any inorganic matter would remain within their bodies for several weeks until eventually being cast out.[5]Gelatinous cubes reproduced asexually by either dividing themselves into two smaller cubes of equal sizes[6] or via budding. In the second case, a smaller, rubbery cube was excreted into a side corridor or on a pile of refuse, and left to fend for itself until it grew into a full-sized cube. These smaller cubes were not cared for and ran the risk of being absorbed by their own parents on their next trip down the corridor.[4] Surviving young cubes then rapidly grew to adult sizes.[6]When two gelatinous cubes met, they could temporarily fuse into a larger form that acted like a single creature. They could remain in that fused form for up to a few days before splitting and going their separate ways.[6]These creatures were typically found inhabiting underground locations or dungeons.[4][3] They were more common in heavily frequented dungeons, attracted by the more readily available food and carrion.[4][3][5]Some creatures considered gelatinous cubes to be ideal means of cleaning out their dungeon lairs of all manner of organisms. Some tried to cultivate larger cubes in order to ensure that they could reach mosses or similar organisms that collected on ceilings.[5]According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv, gelatinous cubes and other oozes were either fragments or the spawn of Juiblex. While this claim was not widely believed, the demon lord could exert control over them, imbuing them with a sense of purpose and even intelligence.[8]The Imperial Zoo of Amn successfully kept a gelatinous cube in captivity for about 12 years in the mid\u201214th century DR.[6]The adventurer Haptooth claimed to have developed an oral antidote against the gelatinous cube's paralyzing secretion after years exploring Undermountain.[6]The Waterdhavian dungeon complex of Undermountain contained numerous gelatinous cubes.[9] In the late 15th century DR, the wizard Halaster Blackcloak, while experimenting with the duergar ability to enlarge their bodies, created a giant gelatinous cube that measured 30\u202ffeet (9.1\u202fmeters) on a side.[10]Glabbagool, an unusual sentient gelatinous cube.",

The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\nThe possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends. ",

        "description": "Often this state of existence was because of a soul having been horrendously evil in life,[5][6][7] their deaths being tremendously emotional, being denied a proper burial,[5][6] or because they had unfinished business.[1]These spirits typically resembled how they had in life. However, some ghosts had an altered appearance due to the nature of their demise. Others were known to be capable of changing their appearance to suit their current disposition.[3][2] Often this altered appearance was due to the alignment they had in life.[3]A ghost's behavior was typically similar to the personality they had in life.[3] But in some cases, their personalities were altered by the process of death.[2]The \"unfinished business\" that drove ghosts varied widely. Some might seek to fulfill an oath, others to relay a message to a loved one, while some might simply desire to have their death avenged.[1] They also tended to get enraged whenever items their bodies were buried with were stolen and would stop at nothing to get them back.[3]Evil-aligned ghosts were said to hate goodness and all forms of life,[3][5][6][7] being driven by a sense of wickedness and spite.[1] As well as a desire to end the lives of other creatures,[3][5][6][7] in particular those responsible for or connected to its death.[1]Sometimes ghosts were unaware that they had died and thus would continually act out the daily routine they had in life.[1] Sometimes ghosts only had fragmented memories of their life.[2]Being a form of undead, ghosts had no need for the air, food, drink, or sleep that they formerly required in life. They moved about by flying. Having incorporeal bodies, they could pass through solid objects.[1] Some were known to use this phasing ability to surprise enemies.[2] When moving they made no noise.[8]Prior to the Spellplague, humans and demihumans killed by a ghost typically remained dead permanently,[7] due to having had all their life-essence drained out of them.[5][6]Occasionally ghosts in the Realms were capable of causing all magical items within 60\u202ffeet (18\u202fmeters) of them to glow with a cold, white radiance.[10]Anything they possessed when they manifested was ethereal, possessing the ghost touch property. These were often things they were buried with.[3][8] If someone were to take the original material item that a ghost's copy was based on, then the ethereal copy would fade away.[3]A ghost dragon and a doomsphere.Ghosts were known to occur in any type of region,[5][6] but they were most often found haunting areas at night.[5][6][7] Ghosts typically were tied to and haunted the area in which they died, though there were a few mobile forces of them.[17] Sailors who died out at sea alongside their vessel could potentially manifest upon an incorporeal reflection of it.[18]Places haunted by ghosts tended to emanate sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled desires. Haunted locations often had certain areas where there were strange noises, an unnatural silence, an unnatural feeling of cold, or inanimate objects moving around. Though such manifestations would be due to the ghost's presence, the spirit did not intentionally manifest them and it had no control over them.[1]In Cormanthyr, the ghosts of many elves and dwarves haunted the ruins of the Old Elven Court.[19]Unusually for a non-abandoned city, ghosts were a somewhat common sight in Velen.[20]Besides the Prime Material plane, ghosts were often known to be found in the Shadowfell,[21] including the Domains of Dread, such as Barovia.[22]Like many types of undead, ghosts knew all languages that they had known in life.[1]A ghost could be controlled by wizards, sorcerers, liches, etc. In this case, the ghost was finally put to rest when destroyed on the material plane or the master of the ghost died. This was usually uncommon though, because to raise a ghost used a lot more magic than raising a regular undead.[citation needed]Some ghosts were willing to work with or for other creatures if they believed that doing so could help them achieve their desires. They were often seen in the company of flameskulls, larva mages, rot harbingers, and spectres.[2]Besides mere creatures, some ghosts acted as servants of deities, such as Kiaransalee.[23] The ghosts of diligent priests of Moradin were said to haunt certain trails, old abandoned delves, and mountain passes \u2014 in these places they would appear before lost dwarves or the allies of dwarves, especially during harsh weather, and guide them along a safe route to either their destination or some form of refuge.[24]",

        "description": "A ghoul appeared as an emaciated, roughly humanoid creature with an almost-hairless mottled, decaying hide stretched tight over its bones. It had the sharp teeth of a carnivore and sunken eyes that burned as if they were hot coals.[3]Ghouls could paralyze their victims with a claw or bite wound, though elves were immune. Paralysis lasted at least a dozen seconds and up to half a minute.[3][5] Like most types of undead, ghouls were immune to mind affecting spells, such as sleep.[5]The bite of a ghoul also inflicted a terrible disease, ghoul fever, deteriorating health and agility within a day. Any who died from the illness rose as a ghoul at midnight.[3]Ghouls sought to ambush and surprise unwary victims wherever they could, usually hiding behind gravestones or in shallow graves they could swiftly burst out of.[3] Once up close, they would slash at victims with their filthy claws and fangs.[5]Aside from the standard ghoul, a number of other varieties existed:Ghouls hunted alone, in gangs of up to four, or packs of seven to twelve members.[3]It was believed that a living man or woman who'd tasted the flesh of people would rise again as ghouls after they died. This was not proven, but it fitted their cannibalistic behavior. However, others believed that anyone who indulged in extreme debauchery and evil could become a ghoul after death.[3][note 1]Whatever the truth, it was clear that any humanoid who was bitten by a ghoul, contracted ghoul fever, and died of it would inevitably rise as a ghoul themselves the following night, at midnight.[3][5] Unless they were blessed or blessed and resurrected by a cleric before they could turn.[5]The new-risen ghoul lost all the skills and powers it had in life. Their minds became warped, turning them feral yet cunning and hungry for living flesh, becoming in all ways like another ghoul. They were not bound to serve other ghouls, however.[3][5]A more experienced or powerful victim would instead became a ghast.[3]Ghouls had a terrible hunger for carrion. They not only ate the dead, but also preyed on the living. They lurked in graveyards and on battlefields, wherever their foul food was plentiful and the air was thick with the smell of death.[3][5]Along with many other kinds of undead, ghouls were known to hunt within the Battle of Bones in the Western Heartlands by the mid\u201314th century DR.[9] Ghouls also dwelled inside the House of Stone on the edge of the Ardeep Forest.[10]Beyond the Prime Material plane, ghouls could be found in the Domains of Dread.[11]Ghouls spoke whatever languages they'd known in life, typically Common.[3]Some ghouls acted as servants of the deity Kiaransalee.[12]Ghoul warriors emerging from the ground.In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Vajra Valmeyjar, Cybriana, Timoth Eyesbright, Onyx the Invincible, and Priam Agrivar were camping at the base of Stoner's Needle in the Sword Coast lands when ghoul warriors clawed their way out of the earth and snatched at them shortly before dawn. Their blades soon dismembered the undead, though the once-paladin Priam wished he could still turn them.[13]In 1369 DR, during the Pool of Radiance's resurgence in the ruins of Myth Drannor, some of the orcs opposing with the Cult of the Dragon failed to ward off the undead that roamed the ruins. The Dwarven Tombs deep under Myth Drannor became the permanent lair for some of them, turned into hulking, and terrifying orc ghouls.[14]The ghoul is of course based on the gh\u016bl, a demon of Arabic mythology that entered western mythology as the ghoul, with various meanings. Within D&D, in the Al-Qadim setting, the Arabic gh\u016bl was translated more directly as the great ghul and ghul-kin.",

The Merchant Prince of Nyanzaru, Jessamine, asked a group of adventurers, guided by Eku to slay the monstrous beast as a favor, in exchange for clues about the origins of the strange blight affecting resurrected creatures of Chult and Faer\u00fbn.[1]Eku held the adventurers in tracking the Great Ape by finding the signs of its passage.

They were stealthy and used echolocation to locate prey.[3]These bats were easy to startle and tended to kill or drive away any other encountered creatures with their bite.[3]In the 15th century DR, giant bats were commonly known for being the steeds of the Lance Defenders, the army of the dragonborn nation of Tymanther.[7]Around 1374 DR, one could find them stabled by the Zhentarim as mounts within the Temple in the Sky.[8]Dire bats flourished in the deepest regions of the Underdark[9] and Undermountain.[10]Beyond the Prime Material plane, giant bats could be found in the Domains of Dread. With some claiming that they and other bat species were more numerous there than in any other plane of existence.[11]Dire bats were a favored animal of the orc god Shargaas.[12][13]They were used as mounts by members of the Shadovar military[14] and Zhentarim skymages.[15] Shield dwarves of Oghrann in the Upperdark also kept large populations of dire bats to use as mounts as well.[16]Morgan Longbow being attacked by dire bats.The drow kept dire bats both as objects of gambling and steeds.

The latter use as steeds was dangerous for the rider and was done only in some drow cities.

When it bit, it injected a sort of poison[5][3] that reduced a prey's mobility.[3] This poison was weak though and not liable to be fatal.[5]In the late 14th century DR, giant centipedes were sold as fish bait at Skully's Bar and Bait in the city of Ravens Bluff.[6]Monstrous centipedes could be found almost anywhere,[5] but typically they were encountered deep underground.[3]On the surface they were known to infest the fens, moors, and deciduous forests of the Moonshae Isles.[7] They were also known to infest the Vast Swamp between Cormyr and Sembia,[8] the forests of Cormanthor,[9] and the sewers of Waterdeep.[10]They were known to frequently be found in the steppes of the Hordelands, as well as its forests Ama Basin, Hagga Shan, and Shalhoond. They were also a common occurrence in its deserts, the Raurin and Quoya.[11]Evil spellcasters often summoned fiendish monstrous centipedes from the Lower Planes to fight for them.[12]",

They had large scales, sharp fangs that curved inwards and strong muscles. Large constrictor snakes could reach lengths of up to 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm).[4][7]Constrictor snakes were ambush predators. They either dropped onto a target from above or slowly approached their prey while they were sleeping. They bit into their prey with their sharp fangs, anchoring them while they used their powerful muscles to constrict their prey, causing slow suffocation.[4][7]Some constrictor snakes possessed an innate magical ability to charm a target, causing temporary paralyzation.[4]Constrictor snakes were obligate carnivores.[4] A constrictor snake was large enough to kill and consume a small to medium-sized humanoid. Their jaws have evolved to allow them to eat large prey. The jaw became unhinged from their skull, and the lower jaw had a special elastic ligament which allowed it to spread into two halves.[7]Constrictor snakes were found in warm forests and jungles. They were known to live within Cormanthor[12] and the jungles of Chult.[13]The skin of a constrictor snake was a sought after item in many markets. A good quality skin could cost a buyer up to 100 gp.[4] Scaled Ones were known to mix the blood of constrictors with the venom of vipers to concoct the restorative hooloond oil.[14]",

Their bodies were typically covered by a large, chitinous shell.[2] Some species had their eyes atop stalks, allowing them to peak over ledges or around corners.[3]Giant crabs were amphibious creatures, equally capable of surviving on both land and in water.[1][2][3]Giant crabs typically mated in autumn, with males attempting to mate with as many females as they could. The fertilized females were known to bury their eggs in the sand of beaches, which would then hatch the following spring.[2]Giant crabs typically preferred to sneak up on their prey, then catch and dismember them with their large pincers.[2]Some time following its destruction on the Night of Burning Flowers in 647 DR, the castle of Ito-jo in Kozakura was haunted by the ghosts of giant crabs and these hauntings would continue well into the 14th century DR.[5]Around the 14th century DR, one could purchase a leg or whole body of a giant crab to dine upon at Sharkey's Bar & Grill near Ravens Bluff.[6]In the 15th century DR, coven of sea hags dwelling in the Sargauth Level of Undermountain used giant crabs as their mounts and pets.[7]Giant crabs typically made their homes along shorelines, with some burrowing into the sand at day and only coming out to feed around dusk and dawn. Though they were also known to hunt during the morning and night.[2]Giant crabs were known to often feed upon large dead fish and other forms of carrion that sank beneath the waves or washed up on shores. Their tendency to feast upon large carrion along the seafloor was considered an important ecological niche. They were also known to venture into the water in search of fish.[2]In northwest Faer\u00fbn, giant crabs could be found in the Stump Bog.[8]In the Zakhara region's Crowded Sea, they could be found on the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan. Particularly in its bay Batihat al-Saji and the islands of Jazayir al-Alfar and Uyun al-Sartan. Those that inhabited the last island were known as \"the children of Sartan.\"[9]Though difficult to train, some aquatic rangers were known to have them as animal companions.[10]On the surface, giant crabs were often hunted by humans and demihumans for their meat and hard chitinous shells. The latter of which were prized by some as a material for constructing armor and shields.[2]The militia of the Haifami was one such group that wielded shields, fancifully-decorated, that were carved from the shells of giant crabs.[11]",

In some environs, they were very rare, but in others they were common (though still much rarer than their smaller cousins).[3]These beasts purely relied on their natural weapons: ferocious bites and whips of their tails. Their bites grappled opponents until they found the strength to break out, and their quick tail whips could knock enemies prone.[1] They were able to sneak up on prey and surprise them before launching an assault.[3]In 1357 DR, a giant-crocodile-riding quasit roamed the sewers of Waterdeep.[5]In 1374 DR, these creatures were used as guardians for the Shadowscale Warren in the Shadow Swamp.[6]Much like their smaller versions, giant crocodiles either lived on their own or in small colonies.[2]These huge creatures often hunted inhabitants that lurked in saltwater environments, such as sharks and small-sized whales. They were also known to attack fishing boats by trying to capsize them, and then eat all the already-caught fish.[3]Giant crocodiles were spotted in many places over Toril in the continents of Faer\u00fbn,[7][8][9][10] Maztica,[11] and Zakhara.[12][13] Beyond the Zakharan mainland, giant crocodiles could be found in the Crowded Sea on the island of Djinni's Claws.[14]In the Kara-tur region, they could be found in the rivers of Akari island.[15]Outside of the Prime Material plane, they were noted to dwell in the Shadow Swamp in the Plane of Shadow.[6][16]The crushed scales of these giant beasts were used in the powerful jungle avatar spell by Zakharan priests.[13]",

The tongues of these beasts could grow up to 18\u202fft (5.5\u202fm) long.[3]All species of giant frog held a great fear towards fire and would try to get as far away from it as they could.[3][4]Due to their extended size, a giant frog could jump up to 10\u202fft (3\u202fm) high,[1][3] and across gaps that were 20\u202fft (6.1\u202fm) wide, even from being completely stationary.[1] In earlier ages, some scholars noted specimens that could jump even greater heights, up to 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm).[4]These monstrous frogs were well camouflaged, so it was likely that their prey would be surprised. They would use their large adhesive tongues to capture and restrain foes.[3]In combat, these beasts bit their foes, and usually grappled them in the process. Small creatures were often swallowed whole after being restrained by the frog's bite, causing the internal acids to wear away at it.[1]Ruke Diggot suffered the fate of being swallowed whole by one of these hulking amphibians.[5]Giant frogs formed packs, although they didn't have a sophisticated hierarchy.[3]A giant frog devours a humanoid.These creatures mostly ate insects, small creatures, and fish,[3] as well as birds and rats.[4]They were also capable of devouring other large creatures whole, including humans,[4][5] halflings, and elves.[4]Giant frogs were found in almost all natural areas of fresh water \u2014 lakes, rivers, marshes, and swamps.[4]They were known to inhabit many places all around Faer\u00fbn, including the Mere of Dead Men,[8] the Vast Swamp,[9] the Mortick Swamp,[10] Phlan,[11] the Nagaflow[12], and in the Underdark, particularly Undermountain.[13]Outside of Faer\u00fbn, giant frogs were known to be found in many of the tropical forests and swamps of Maztica.[14]Large aquatic creatures, such as giant species of fish, giant turtles,[4][3] and Giant snakes were often known to prey upon them. Although giant frogs hunted very frequently, they knew their boundaries and place in the food chain, thus they did their best to avoid such predators.[4]Some giant frogs were known to keep the company of bullywugs. Bullywugs, as they were able to communicate with frogs and toads, formed bonds with these large frogs. Bullywugs trained the frogs to be protectors that could also hunt food for them. The ability of these frogs to swallow their prey whole allowed for the bullywugs to transport their future meals back to camp simply and efficiently.[15]In the Flooded Forest, there were rumors of giant frogs forming druidic circles and being capable of casting spells.[16]",

Their fur coloration gave them an advantage when hiding within areas of tall grass.[3]Hyenas fought in packs and were intelligent enough to send some of the members to circle and flank their prey. They were capable of tripping with their sharp jaws.[3]Gnolls, unsurprisingly, had a strong affinity for hyenas, keeping many as pets or guards.[6] The Mulhorandi god Set also favored hyenas, using them as omens for his followers.[7]In the Shining South hyenas were known to be found in and around the Channath Vale, Dambrath, Durpar, Estagund, the Gnollwatch Mountains, the Great Rift, and the Shaar.[8] North of this region, they could be found wandering the Raurin desert.[9]",

Giant lizards were known to be hunted upon by black dragons.[3]In northwest Faer\u00fbn, giant lizards could be found in the Stump Bog.[6] Beyond the Prime Material plane, like most mundane animals these creatures could be found in the Beastlands.[7]",

        "description": "Giant octopuses resembled regular octopuses, only much larger, being some 9\u201312 feet (2.7\u20133.6 meters) across.[3][4] Their tentacles alone were at least 10 feet (3 meters) long. These could be studded with barbs and suckers with sharp edges.[2] They were normally colored brown to grey. They had a deep-yellow beak with a bright-orange mouth and tongue.[3][4]Hampering descriptions, however, was the fact that giant octopuses had an incredible capacity for camouflage, being able to change their colors and contort and squeeze their bodies to blend in with their environment.[3][4][2] They could manifest many different colors and patterns, with green to deep black, red stripes, and blue speckles all known. They typically disguised their tentacles as seaweed. There was only a slight chance of spotting one so disguised, and it was often only the eyes that revealed them.[4]AD5 Things You Should Never Do With Your Money, According to ExpertsBy The Penny HoarderGiant octopuses were aggressive and territorial predators.[2] Though animals, they were considered to be very patient, cunning and even malevolent, but survival was their main focus.[3][4]They would freely grab swimmers in the water and even small watercraft to seize and devour their crews. They could stop a craft in its course or even sink it altogether. Sometimes, a crewmember who'd gone missing in the night had fallen prey to a giant octopus, swiftly yanked over the side and consumed without a trace. A wounded or hungry giant octopus switched to scavenging, eating everything it could, down to small crustaceans and seaweed.[3][4]They were typically solitary creatures,[3][4][2] but would occasionally cooperate in groups of up to three to attack large ships or other food sources.[3][4]Adventurers defending themselves from a gigantic octopus.A giant octopus had up to eight tentacles to attack with, making it a complex and deadly opponent. Usually, it spared two to anchor itself and attacked with the remaining six. While it could simply strike with the barbed member, it could easily grab hold and then constrict its prey with crushing force. It would also try to drag prey close enough for its savage beak to bite and eat it.[3][4][2]To escape a giant octopus's grasp, it was often vital to attack the tentacles themselves, though it would fight back. If three or four or more tentacles were severed, the wounded giant octopus would most likely try to retreat and hide or return to its lair, and camouflage itself.[3][4][2]To cover its escape, the giant octopus could eject a cloud of jet-black ink that utterly obscured the vision of all creatures caught inside.[3][4][2] This cloud could be roughly 60 feet wide, 60 feet long, and 20 feet high (18.3 by 18.3 by 6.1 meters)[3][4] or 20 feet (6.1 meters) in all dimensions. They could do this freely about once a minute.[2]At the same time, the giant octopus could jet backward in a straight line at up to nearly seven times its normal swimming speed.[2]Thanks to its camouflage, a giant octopus was skilled at hiding, and its ability to compress its body let it squeeze through many small gaps or escape traps. They were very skilled swimmers.[2]A giant octopus could regrow severed tentacles, in 2\u20133 months[4] or in only 11\u201320 days.[2]Giant octopuses mated in spring. They deposited their eggs in a reef, and left their young to fend for themselves.[3][4]Dwelling in warm waters of shallow to medium depth, they made their lairs in underwater caves and even inside shipwrecks. These lairs might hold the inedible remains and treasures of their victims. Giant octopuses preferred to move and hunt at night. Their territories were quite small, and they waited for prey to approach them.[3][4]Around Faer\u00fbn, giant octopuses could be found in the south in the Great Sea[7] and in the Shining Sea, where they lurked in the sunken ruins of Untisczer.[8] Around the Moonshaes, cold-water giant octopuses laired in winding natural sinkholes beneath the pirate cove of Eiresse on the island of Gwynneth.[9]Around Kara-Tur, giant octopuses could be found in the seas of the east. In Wa, they infested the waters off the coast from the city of Hotomori on the southern side of island of Tsukishima, hindering salvage of a shipwreck around 1357 DR.[6] In Koryo in 1356 DR, a cuddlefish from the deep sea swam into the floating city section of Tu Pe; it killed four men before being captured.[10]Beyond the Prime Material plane, giant octopuses could be found in the waters of Stygia.[11] Dark giant octopuses could be found lurking in the Shadow Swamp on the Plane of Shadow.[12]Some acted as servants of the marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.[13]Though very difficult to train, some aquatic rangers were known to have them as animal companions.[14]The hide of a giant octopus was tough, leathery, and waterproof. Sailors who by some chance caught and killed one could turn their skin into fine ponchos to keep the rain off.[3][4]However, giant octopuses were most often hunted for their ink. It could be used to scribe magical scrolls.[3][4]A piece of a giant octopus tentacle was one of the material components of the battle tentacles spell.[15]In the Blade Kingdoms, cuttlefish was considered a sizable, but somewhat disappointing feast centerpiece dish.[16]In reality, the cuttlefish is a small sea creature unrelated to octopuses except that they are both cephalopods. However, the Monstrous Manual and Monstrous Compendium Volume Two give \"cuttlefish\" as the name of the giant octopus. Furthermore, the common misspelling \"cuddlefish\" is used in Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms, page 118, to refer to a deadly sea monster; this is presumed to refer to the giant octopus. Therefore, this wiki adopts \"cuttlefish\"/\"cuddlefish\" to refer to the giant octopus, with apology to marine biologists.",

When possible, giant owls would band together to attack in concert.[2]Giant owls could be often encountered by the traders traveling from Luskan to Ten Towns of Icewind Dale. The smaller creatures, those less than 4\u202fft (1.2\u202fm) in height, were in danger of being preyed upon by these nocturnal birds.[6]In the Unapproachable East, giant owls could be found in the forests of Rashemen.[7]A giant owl being used as a mount.Giant owls could be trained to serve as mounts.[8] They often served in this role with wood elves, besides being their companions, because of their common vision of the world and nature.[9]Trained giant owl could be found in the library of the Society of Stalwart Adventurers of Suzail. The librarian owl retrieved and put away books alongside flying monkeys.[10]Circa the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, one could find giant owls stabled, bred, sold and used as mounts by the Zhentarim within the Temple in the Sky and other Zhentarim outposts in the Spine of the World.[11]",

These species had different sizes, habits, and methods of attack.[1]All types of giant snake were carnivorous. They were deadly predators, and often sought out other giant animals, such as giant frogs.[2]Giant snakes either attacked by utilizing their natural poisons or constricting their prey.[1]These giant serpents could survive in all but the coldest climates.[1] As such, giant snakes were known to have inhabited many places within Faer\u00fbn,[3][4][5][6][7][8][9] Kara-Tur,[10] and Zakhara.[11] The Forest of Amtar in Dambrath was full of reptiles, such as giant snakes.[3]Priests of Sseth were known to construct special shields by treating the shed skin of giant snakes and wrapping them around a core of ironwood.[12]In 1357 DR, many settlements along the Tumen River in Koryo were destroyed by such creatures.[10]In 1373 DR, Zasian Menz and Kaanyr Vhok used a portal that connected a giant snake to the stomach of a storm dragon.

        "description": "These monstrous sharks were some of the largest predators in the ocean.[5] They ranged in sizes of 20 to 65\u202ffeet (6.1 to 20\u202fmeters) in length,[4][5] with the larger sizes being more prevalent in ancient times,[4] and weighed between 10\u201260\u202ftons (9,100\u201254,000\u202fkg). Some were rumored to even reach lengths of 80 to 90\u202ffeet (24 to 27\u202fmeters).[5]Much like other sharks, megalodons were constantly in motion and driven by a voracious appetite. They were attracted by noises and would attack any creature they perceived as being edible.[4][5]Megalodons would go into frenzies when blood was in their watery habitats.[1][3][4] However, whenever this occured it was due to fishermen or other creatures hunting large aquatic life like whales. This is because their habit of swallowing prey whole almost never left any blood in the ocean.[3]Megalodons had very keen senses. They could smell from up to a 1\u202fmile (1,600\u202fmeters) away[5] and sense motions from up to the same distance.[3] They also could see around itself in a radius of 180\u202ffeet (55\u202fmeters).[5]These sharks could leap as high as 40\u202ffeet (12\u202fmeters) out of the water.[5] Much like other species of shark, megalodons needed to be constantly moving in order to force sufficient oxygen-rich water through their gills. Thus they would die if held immobile for a prolonged period. The other natural weakness of sharks shared by this species was that their thick, flexible cartilage tissue offered poor protection for their internal organs.[3]Megalodons were more effective at grappling their prey than other species of shark[5] and were capable of swallowing most things whole with their massive jaws.[5]The grand king of all sahuagin was rumored to possess a massive megalodon as a mount and guardian.[3]Megaladons lived either solitarily or in packs of up to five or twenty members.[2]Megalodons were a carnivorous species.[4] They were capable of swallowing some species of whale whole and would leap out of the water to bite at low-flying rocs. They were even known to attack members of their own species.[5]Beyond Toril, these creatures inhabited the planets of Armistice and Thalassa.[6]Outside of the Prime Material plane, there were fiendish megalodons that inhabited an ocean within the Gaping Maw layer of the Abyss.[7] They could also occasionally be found in Draga Salt-Biter's domain of Saragoss in the Domains of Dread.[8]Dragons were among the few creatures that megalodons were known to yield towards, though even then some would leap out of the water and bite at low-flying ones.[5]",

Lolth, the Queen of Spiders, was bound to have giant spiders serving her.[6]Giant spiders could attack in a variety of ways, typically whatever way their normal counterparts could. Some spun huge webs that prey easily stumbled into, while others spat a deadly poison. Some were capable of walking on ceilings, while others were not. Despite the differences between the types of giant spiders, all were formidable opponents and certainly not foes for any arachnophobes to face.[6]Giant spiders' viscera was iridescent gold and purple in color. If it came in contact with a humanoid's skin, it had a burning and irritating effect, leaving skin enflamed with red splotches, however, it was mostly harmless.[7]",

They were often attracted to settled areas, where they preyed upon livestock such as chickens, goats, and even sheep.[2]Giant toads preferred to live in temperate areas with bodies of water they could lay their eggs in. Though they were species that survived in rather cool or dry environments.[2]They often made their homes underground, enjoying both the damp air and steady supply of food such environments offered them. Because of this, they occasionally be found within the sewers of cities.[2]In northwest Faer\u00fbn, giant toads could be found within the Mere of Dead Men.[5] In interior Faer\u00fbn they could be found in the Farsea Marshes, the Marsh of Tun, and the Vast Swamp.[6] In southeast Faer\u00fbn they could be found in the Great Swamp of Rethild.[7]Beyond Faer\u00fbn, they could be found in the prairie regions of Semphar.[8]",

Upon sighting anything on the ground that appeared injured or dead, a giant vulture would quickly swoop down to investigate.[4]Giant vultures had a keen eyesight comparable to that of any eagle, falcon, or hawk.[4] Due to their dietary habits, they possessed a natural resistance to many forms of disease as well as organic poisons.[3]These creatures typically laid around five to eight eggs, which would hatch within a span of two months. Their hatchlings were not capable of flight until at least four months of age.[3]The Sea Maidens Faire kept a giant vulture aboard the sailing ship the Heartbreaker, as part of their menagerie.[5]Giant vultures lived in roaming flocks, typically of up to twelve members.[3]Like all species of vultures, these creatures were carrion eaters. They fed upon creatures that were either injured or already dead. Though they were also liable to attack creatures that were unconscious, restrained, or sleeping.[3][4]Giant vultures typically inhabited high altitudes, such as mountains, within temperate or tropical regions.[3][4] In Faer\u00fbn they were known to be found around parts of the Dalelands, Cormyr, and Sembia.[6] In Maztica, they were known to be encountered all across its deserts.[7]In the Hordelands they could occasionally be found at the Katakoro Plateau, as well as in the land's following mountain ranges - A-Ling Shan, Chigiogi, Dustwall, Hagga Shan, Katakoro Shan, Khopet-Dag, Kora Shan, Kun-Yen Shan, Raurin Alta, Teyla Shan, Ulhai Shan, Yehimal.[8]In the Zakhara region's Crowded Sea, they could be found on the island chain of Nada al-Hazan[9] and the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan.[10]Some races were known to domesticate giant vultures. They were capable of being trained to stay within a specific region and to associate specific creatures with food, though only if they were raised since a young age.[3] Their eggs and hatchlings typically fetched prices of around 30 to 60 gp.[3][2]The spell flight of Remnis could summon a giant vulture to the aid of its caster.[11]",

Though a giant wasp would survive these wings being burned off, their body would be rendered permanently flightless.[4]Giant wasps fought other creatures with their powerful mandibles and poisonous, paralyzing stingers.[4]At some point in the 14th century DR, a group of rangers introduced giant wasps into the Rimwood. Their intention was to hopefully drive out the area's fyrefly population by having the giant wasps compete with them for their precious cornflower pollen. However, this proved to be unsuccessful as the fyreflies adapted to eating quack grass and dried pigweed.[5]These creatures were carnivorous and hunted on a very regular basis, almost ceaselessly, which inspired a sense of fear in some creatures. They typically fed upon other giant insects, though humanoid races were also known to fall victim to them.[4]Giant wasps were known to make their nests out of either mud or \"paper\", with the latter supporting far larger adult populations that ranged from twenty one to forty members.[4][note 1]If a giant wasp did not outright devour their paralyzed prey they were known to bring it back to their nests and place the paralyzed creature in their eggs.[4]Giant wasps were one of the few insects known to thrive in the North,[6] in places such as the Rimwood of Cormanthor, the Farsea Marshes,[7] and the Stump Bog.[8]In northeast Faer\u00fbn, they could be found in the forests of Vaasa.[9] And in West Faerun, giant wasps could be found in the land of High Moor.[10]They could also be found in the Moonshae Isles,[11] Thar,[12] and in the Shining South, they were known to inhabit the Mortick Swamp.[13]A small number of awakened giant wasps served the druid Wyllow within her domain of Undermountain.[14]Beyond the Prime Material plane, they could be found in Malbolge.[15]The Fire Knives coated their knives with the poison of giant wasps.[16] Their wings could be used as an alternative ingredient for crafting a potion of speed.[17]An amber amulet of vermin contained a wasp that would be released, at which point it would become a giant wasp.[18]",

And rarely, some giant weasels were born with an entirely black coloration.[4]Giant weasels had a unique agent within their saliva that, when in contact with a creature's open wound, prevented the clotting process in blood and promoted greater bleeding.[4]Giant weasels were known to be far more vicious than their smaller cousins and were often just as willing to attack humanoid creatures as they were normal prey.[4]Once a giant weasel had its jaws locked onto a creature it was very reluctant to let go and would suck at their victim's blood. Due to the special agent within their saliva, the amount of bleeding would be excessive.[4]Unlike their smaller cousins, who were rather solitary creatures, giant weasels typically lived and hunted in packs.[4]A number of giant weasels were known to serve the mad druid Wyllow within her domain of Undermountain.[6]Giant weasels were also known to inhabit the fens, salt flats, and coniferous forests of the Moonshae Isles,[7] the forests of Cormanthor,[8] and Semberholme.[9]Much like their smaller cousins, giant weasels were often trained and domesticated to be hunting companions or guard animals.[5][4] Kobolds were one of many races known for domesticating giant weasels, but unlike larger races they were known to use them as mounts.[10]Before the Second Sundering, giant weasel pelts were generally known to sell found around 1,000 to 6,000 gp.[4][5] The white pelts of the northern giant weasel, as well as the pelts of the rare black giant weasel, both typically sold for more.[4]Giant weasels were favored animals of the gnomish gods Garl Glittergold and Segojan Earthcaller.[11]",

        "description": "Giant wolf spiders were smaller than usual giant spiders, but were more agile. As such, they were much faster at crawling and climbing. Like giant spiders, they had the ability to climb awkwardly shaped walls and hang upside down on ceilings, sense when a creature was caught in their web, and travel well across webbing.[1]They were less strong than giant spiders, but were more intelligent, robust, and wise. As such, when combined with their superior speed, they were fantastic stalkers. This allowed them to hunt their foes across plains, underground, or in burrows.[1]Wolf spiders were said to have very good eyesight and potentially even a basic sense of smell.[3] In addition, they tracked their prey by the use of their scent-detecting organs, which were located in their pedipalps.[4]Female wolf spiders were incredibly protective of their offspring, which often numbered in the hundreds. As such, they were known to carry their offspring in little cocoons under their stomachs, or sometimes the offspring would even ride their mothers.[4]A giant wolf spider prepares to fight its foes.Due to their great tracking abilities, these arachnids often descended from rooftops or hid under spongy surfaces to surprise their enemies.[5]Giant wolf spiders relied on their bite in order to take down their foes. As well as piercing their opponents, their bite was poisonous. If the poison caused their foe to become unconscious, the poison would remain in their system for an hour, as well as causing them to be paralyzed.[1]Giant wolf spiders made their homes in many different habitats, such as deserts, grassland, forests, and hills.[6] Specifically, wolf spiders often made their homes in silk-lined burrows.[4]These giant arachnids were known to lurk in many places across Faer\u00fbn, such as Omu in Chult,[7] the Western Heartlands,[8] and the Braeryn of the Underdark city of Menzoberranzan.[5] Giant wolf spiders were known to skulk around some areas in Maztica, such as in the hilltop ruins of the Ixtul Valley.[9]A great threat to a female wolf spider was another female wolf spider. On sight, they would fight each other to the death, and the victor would bear responsibility to raise the fallen spider's young.[4]In Eleint 1367 DR, an adventurer slew a huge yellow giant wolf spider in the woods south of Shadowdale. Somehow, it emitted a magical glow, even after it had died. Not willing to give up such a grand trophy for nothing, the adventurer took it to Jhaele Silvermane of the Old Skull Inn. She traded the glowing spider corpse for a week's stay at the inn with as much ale as the seller could manage.[10]In the 14th century DR, the evil goddess Loviatar was known to send wolf spiders to her followers in order to show her favor.[11] In the 15th century DR, many druids of the Realms had the ability to wildshape into giant wolf spiders.[12]",

        "description": "These bizarre creatures appeared as large blobs composed entirely of mouths and eyes. When the eyes and mouths were closed, the gibbering mouther resembled a large lump of earth.[4]Gibbering mouthers were not natural creatures. Usually, they were the creation of foul sorcery.[1] Some sages instead claimed that gibbering mouthers arose from sentient creatures that had died in places touched by the Far Realm.[2]Gibbering mouthers reproduced by asexual fission. They would split their amorphous bodies down the middle whenever they had consumed enough nutrients to support two bodies. The mouther would hide in a secure area while performing this process, since it could take up to four hours. Once split, the two mouthers would move away from each other.[4]Every victim consumed by a gibbering mouther added another mouth and pair of eyes to the mass of the beast's body. Only living prey would work for this.[4]Some sages believed that bringing two gibbering mouthers together would cause them to join, creating a larger mouther.[4]Gibbering mouthers liked to ambush prey by remaining still until their prey was within striking range.[4]The most vulnerable area on a gibbering mouther was the brain, which was located near the center of its mass and could move around, making it difficult to strike.[4]Gibbering mouthers could use a special babbling attack that had the same effect as the confusion spell. This attack assaulted potential prey every few moments, making it more difficult for them to resist.[4]Spit from a gibbering mouther would explode with a bright flash once it struck any surface, easily blinding targets for several minutes.[4]A gibbering mouther was able to attack with six different mouths at a time. Each mouth had a chance to latch on to the victim and begin draining their energy.[4]The ground around a gibbering mouther was turned into a thick liquid state, making it extremely difficult to assault the mouther at a close range.[4]In 1367 DR, during the Living Gem War, the wizard Shond Tharovin was cursed by the archmage Yoond Shalshymmyr and permanently changed into an immense (over twelve-miles-long[6]) gibbering mouther, sacrificing his life to do so. Shond vowed revenge and left his city of Schamedar to enter the ocean.[7][8] Shond eventually settled on the Singing Rocks in the Trackless Sea, where he planned the demise of his enemies.[6]These creatures were never found near others of their kind.[4]Gibbering mouthers were omnivorous creatures.[4]Swamps were their preferred habitat in the wild.[4]In Northwest Faer\u00fbn, they could be found dwelling within the Mere of Dead Men.[9] Beyond Faer\u00fbn, they were sometimes found in Zakhara.[4]Wizards and cults often used gibbering mouthers as guardians.[4]They were a favored monster of the drow deity Ghaunadaur.[10]",

        "description": "With a broad, muscular body, a glabrezu stood 9\u201215\u202fft (2.7\u20124.6\u202fm) tall and weighed 5,500\u202flb (2,500\u202fkg)[3][5] Their most physically bewildering feature was their two pairs of arms, each with a different extremity. While their main arms were monstrous limbs that ended in powerful pincers, the smaller humanoid pair ended in clawed hands and protruded from the stomach. Goat horns adorned the top of their canine heads and numerous fangs rested in their muzzles. Their skin was wrinkly and ranged in tone from deep russet to pitch black. A pair of cold, purple, piercing eyes hinted at their great intelligence, contrasting with their bestial appearance.[3][5]Despite their physical prowess, glabrezus preferred to work behind the scenes, both on the Prime Material Plane and in the Abyss. Glabrezus took pleasure in the act of temptation, luring all they met with lies, deception, and offers of power before ruining their victims' lives.[1] The secret agendas of a glabrezu were many, their complicated schemes and spiteful plots for vengeance sometimes taking centuries to millennia to finally come to fruition. Furthering their guile was their commanding presence, as they had a strong air of authority they used to enhance their arguments.[9]Glabrezus did not offer pleasures of the flesh, but tempted those of weak wills and great ambition with promises of unparalleled influence. They collected vast sums of gold, magical items, and other useful bargaining chips and stored them all underground in a massive hoard. They were unable to change, or polymorph, their frightening appearance, so they usually visited mortals in secret, often using telepathy to speak directly in their prey's mind. Sometimes they made their nature known while at others they tried to manipulate their targets by inciting paranoia or twisting their sense of right and wrong.[4][9]Glabrezus had access to a wide variety of spells, including the power to spontaneously generate darkness and dispel magic. They had truesight that extended as far as their telepathic communication that they could use in concert during their dealings so as to avoid being seen and to prevent acts of deception. Both their arms were fully functional, but they made more use of their claws in combat in order to grapple their enemies. Although they could travel between the planes freely, they usually only came to the mortal plane when summoned.[1]Glabrezus could cast wish for a mortal once per month.[3]A glabrezu in combat with Drizzt Do'Urden.Glabrezus preferred deception to combat, particularly if it served no actual purpose. They would rather have their minions do the work if they did not need to do it themselves, and through their corrupting ways could turn allies into enemies and brainwash companions into fighting one another. However, they had no qualms about direct confrontation and did not hesitate to wade into battle, in fact embracing any chance to burst into violence.[3][2][9][12]Unlike normal magic users, glabrezus did not stand behind their minions casting spells, but ran straight into combat using chaos-inducing powers to send the battlefield into disarray.[3][2] A glabrezu's normal strategy in combat was to use their confusion spell-like ability before using chaos hammer or unholy blight to finish off wounded foes. They might also use reverse gravity to launch enemies into the air before letting them drop back down, or combine it with power word stun (which was usually saved for the strongest opponent) to send them careening helplessly into the air.[9] They casually used dispel magic while dealing with other problems using their various physical and magical abilities.Throughout a fight, a glabrezu might summon demons great in size or number.[3][2] They were powerful enough to have little compunction about doing this if the battle was difficult, as unlike lesser demons they were not concerned with needing to compensate the help for their services.[9] Little prevented them from teleporting at will across the battlefield, and they were willing to simply leave the fight to harass their foes another day.Quinix on his throne in the Gate of Iron Fangs.Glabrezus, for all their terrifying presence and wish-granting abilities, only occupied a middle class amongst the demons of the Abyss.[1] While they were hardly great generals, they were normally in charge of many lesser demons and led by example.[2] Often, they performed espionage and acted as advisers or chief lieutenants for more powerful demons, using their skill in trickery to aid their masters' endeavors. Under normal circumstances they never traveled together, and seeing multiple at once was likely the result of their mirror image ability.[9]Demonic opinions on the glabrezus varied depending on who was asked, although most lesser demons like chasmes and dretches rightfully feared them.[13] Mariliths, on the other hand, were dismissive and hateful towards the glabrezus despite their mutual love of planning. While glabrezus favored subtlety and temptations, mariliths felt these games were inferior to true warfare and would prefer to wipe the glabrezus out completely, settling for attempts to discredit them to higher-ups. Meanwhile, the balors were in favor of the corrupting tactics of the glabrezus, giving them work as spies and counselors.[14] Lilitus had a similar fondness for the manipulative glabrezus, sharing their love of subtle corruption.[15]The glabrezus played little role in the combative side of the Blood War, instead focusing on their sinister schemes. Though not as direct as the warmongering of the mariliths, glabrezu ploys were part of a deeper evil, a more insidious form of subjugation. Their monstrous appearance belied their societal role as the Abyss's covert agents, exerting their influence on other planes with surgical precision and planting greed in the minds of mortal summoners to secure power for the Abyss in the long-term.[4][10]Glabrezus that became mages were known for their use of direct and destructive magic.[16]A glabrezu being summoned by a drow priestess.Glabrezus were most commonly summoned directly by a mortal, such as ambitious human wizards or drow priestesses who hoped to make a bargain.[4][9] Of the most powerful tanar'ri, they were also the most frequently summoned, though doing so required a true name.[17] They hated it when they were forced to follow the orders of mortals, and avenged themselves by crushing the spirits of those around them once back in the Abyss.[10]Sometimes glabrezus found potential victims on their own, presenting their \"gift\" whether or not the recipient wanted it. If their victims refused their offers, glabrezus thought nothing of slaughtering them instead, as being willing to summon a demon was likely indicative of their fate regardless.[4][9]Glabrezus promised much to mortals, but their capacity to grant wish spells to their \"clients\" was one of their most dangerous offers. Glabrezus required the wish being granted to be for an evil cause that would cause incalculable devastation or suffering. Failing this, they demanded an act of great wickedness be committed as payment, or for the one petitioning them to make an incredible sacrifice. Even worse than asking a glabrezu to grant one's wish was accepting an offer made by the demon itself.[3][9]Among the most fearsome aspects of the glabrezu was their mere presence on the Material plane, as lingering too long caused their corruption to spread. Arrogant mortal summoners often believed they could control glabrezus with ease but the very act of their summoning planted seeds of evil. Their corruption sickened people, animals, and plants alike, even causing the sky itself to grow darker as they leeched off the power of the plane.[2][4]In an unholy, rarely successful ritual, a half-drow, half-glabrezu monstrosity known as a draegloth could be born from a drow priestess. Unlike glabrezus, they were impatient and destructive, only improving their magic that could be used for destructive purposes. They served drow houses as opposed to the masters of the Abyss, but were believed to be a sign of support from Lolth.[18]Glabrezus were some of the earliest demons to appear in the Abyss, a demonic manifestation of mortal envy.[19] The half-organic armor plating underneath their flesh was an indication that they had been tampered with by the ancient obyriths known as sibriexes.[20]Around 1385 DR, Pharaun Mizzrym was killed (for the second time) by magical backlash from a glabrezu.[21]In 1485\u20131486 DR, glabrezus were among the demons that wandered the streets of Menzoberranzan and participated in the failed defense of Q'Xorlarrin against the dwarves. In that conflict, a glabrezu slew former king Connerad Brawnanvil.[22][23]The demon Marilith often traveled with two glabrezu guards.[24]Some glabrezu traveled to the Endless Labyrinth, the 600th layer, in order to capture goristros for use by other demon lords, raids that Baphomet begrudgingly tolerated as a method of raising his own legendary status.[25]Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

Using their performing abilities, some even took the tactic of pretending they were mortally wounded, only to turn around and score a hit on their foe.[2]Some gladiators preferred to hone their skill with less-traditional weapons, such as the cestus.[8][9] Despite the fact they fought on land in arenas, gladiators often trained themselves in the use of nets and tridents.[10][5]Circa the 14th century DR, gladiatorial arenas could be found in the Moonsea city of Hillsfar;[11][12][13] Calimshan in the Lands of Intrigue,[14] the city-state of Reth in the Vilhon Reach,[15] various locales the Dragon Coast[16] and the Old Empires,[17] and perhaps most famously, all across the unforgiving realm of Thay in the Unapproachable East.Tharchions of Thay employed gladiators from many different races, along with monstrous beasts and other fantastic creatures.[16] Due to their size and strength goliaths made perfect gladiators. Slavers were known to steal goliath infants and raise them as brutal fighters for the arena.[18]While gladiatorial contests were forbidden in many other civilized lands during the late 15th century, as of 1479 DR they remained popular in Calimport, where the Pasha Marod el Arhapan held a large number of games in a floating arena.[19] The frontier merchant-city of Port Nyanzaru in Chult also maintained a dedicated arena around that time,[20] and small-scale underground fighting pits were not unheard of, such as that found within the Black Blade and Bloody Boar in Mulmaster.[21]",

Though gnolls were relatively lean for their height, weighing in usually between 280\u2012320\u202flb (130,000\u2012150,000\u202fg), they cut an impressive visage. In part because of their height and lean musculature, gnolls were very quick compared with many other races such as humans.[7] Gnoll skin was greenish-gray, and their furry hide a light or dark brown hue, sometimes marked with spots or stripes. Many gnolls also had a dirty yellow to a reddish-gray crest-like mane that stood on end when they were angry.[7]It is believed by some that gnolls had traces of demonic blood, which may be evidenced by unusual features found among some of the gnoll bloodlines. These may have included talons, gleaming red eyes, or black fur with fiery orange spots.[7]Female gnolls were indistinguishable from males by size, in spite of a reputation for being shorter. In fact, so similar were male and female gnolls in appearance that they were often mistaken for one another. The only reliable way to tell the difference, other than through a close physical examination, was if a female was pregnant or openly nursing.[9]Gnolls had very short lifespans when compared with other sapient humanoids, living only 30 or so years on average and maturing to adulthood at a remarkable speed. Gnolls did not, however, age particularly dramatically except at the end of their lifespans, at which point the decline quickly ended in their death.[7] When a gnoll died, its bones were occasionally harvested by the other gnolls and animated by rituals into a witherling, a type of skeletal gnoll.[10]A gnoll witherling.More so than many other humanoid races, primal instinct was a strong part of the gnoll psyche. Gnolls were natural predators and savored the thrills of the hunt. Almost all gnolls preferred the wilderness to the civilized enclaves favored by humans, dwarves, or other similar races and those that do take to cities have usually thought of them as just another kind of landscape.[7]Many other races found the gnoll psyche feral and aggressive, male and female equally,[9] and the behavioral tendencies of the race certainly gave this impression. Gnolls started fighting among one another at a very early age and many, as soon as they could walk, crawled into places away from the eyes of adults where they engaged in vicious, often lethal battles.[13] A gnoll was more likely to demand answers than to ask a question. Gnolls, however, did not see this as an act of hostility, but a basic demonstration of strength.[7]Though gnolls were not necessarily evil, the craving for the hunt and primal bloodlust that inhabited the gnoll's mind made many of the race lean towards a chaotic evil alignment by reflex. Gnolls that succumbed to this tendency often became nomadic savages, wreaking havoc wherever they could, giving them their fearsome reputation as slaving brigands throughout the world. Fortunately, such creatures were rarely seen united and, although gnolls as a whole have had a strong affinity for family and blood ties, this friendliness was not often extended to those who belonged to a different pack; the race has commonly made war on itself.[14] Some gnolls could suffer from a rare form of madness that could quell their intense hunger and evil instincts, causing guilt for their misdeeds and a pacifistic nature. [15]Other gnoll practices might have seemed equally strange, such as the gnoll propensity for scavenging. At its most basic level, this tendency led many gnolls to collect trophies that remind them of past victories, items sometimes grisly though just as often simple and mundane.[7] Gnoll trackers have used this to their benefit, keeping scraps of clothing or other objects with the scent of their prey on them, which they have used to point them in the direction of their quarry.[16]Gnolls in the middle of razing a village to the ground.This tendency led to the even more alien gnoll practice of carrion-eating. Unlike most races, gnolls had few, if any, qualms about eating the dead of other races. When gnolls struck a village, they did not only leave no survivors but no corpses, eating most of those whom they did not take as slaves. There were even indications that some gnolls took this practice a step further, raiding graveyards for fresh corpses on which to feed.[9]Gnolls were often known to fight with battleaxes, great bows, morningstars, various types of pole arms, and two-handed swords.[6]A gnoll flesh gnawer.Gnolls were generally known to live in warm plains,[4] though they were highly adaptable and could be found living in most regions, sometimes even underground. They were less common in arid and arctic regions.[6]In spite of the savage nature of the gnolls, there were some aspects of their culture that were not inherently repulsive. Gnolls placed a very strong value on the family, for instance, respecting blood ties perhaps more than any other aspect of a relationship. Though gnolls within a pack commonly fought with each other for dominance, these battles were quickly forgotten after their resolution, and in most situations, gnolls of the same bloodline were loyal friends and allies to one another.[7] These bloodlines were almost always traced maternally, through the female line.[9]This loyalty to family was particularly obvious during combat, either with rival gnoll packs or other races. Gnolls who fought side by side regularly threw away personal glory in order to help their brethren. Perhaps most surprisingly, when a gnoll has been separated from clan and family their instinctive need for such blood ties has led them to form a surrogate \"pack\" from those whom they choose to befriend. To these unlikely allies, the gnoll has been as loyal and faithful as they would their own brothers or sisters, embracing the outsiders as if they were family.[7]Some gnoll societies were patriarchal and led by a chieftain, the biggest and strongest of the tribe. Chieftains were known to keep harems and as gnolls bred for fieriness, the harem-wives were the strongest fighters among other males and females, second in war-strength only to the chieftain.[17]The scavenging of wild gnolls rose to entirely new levels as well. While all gnolls had an innate tendency for collecting souvenirs and trophies, nomadic packs, particularly the savage ones who have had little contact with other races except during wartime, have found few other ways to acquire technology, having crafted few tools of their own. The result of this is that most gnolls relied on the other races as their source of wealth and technology. This extends to arms and weaponry, giving gnoll armor a unique aesthetic where each suit is typically made kitbashed together from scavenged pieces of armor found either on victims or abandoned.[13]Gnolls of all kinds have found an affinity for hyenas, who many see as their brethren and whom they have kept as pets or for hunting.[18] Besides hyenas, they were known to keep hyaenodons as pets.[6]Gnolls as depicted by Wayne England.Though gnolls of all kinds had a strong loyalty towards family, they have not extended such courtesies to those outside their pack, and mainstream gnoll culture has had a much-deserved reputation for brutality. Most gnolls were nomadic, wandering from land to land and living off of raids on the local populations. Victims of these attacks can expect no mercy from their attackers and those who are not killed would be taken as slaves to be brutalized and abused both physically and mentally. Gnolls have detested physical labor[18] and so to ensure utter loyalty from slaves have taken their brutalization and maltreatment to an art form. For this purpose, most packs have specialized slavers known as tantekurash or \"spirit breakers\" who have made it their business to break the will of a slave through repetitive torture.[14]The process wreaked on a slave's mind by the tantekurash was brutal and often irrevocable. Those captives who would not submit were eaten, often in front of other slaves as yet another form of torment. Slaves who would accept their fate often lived short and brutal lives, which were ended by them being devoured. Few victims were lucky enough to be rescued and those that were may take months to shake the scars from their psyche and recover.[14]An even less fortunate few find their minds so broken that they have actually embraced the brutality of their captors, becoming the kryshantel or \"savage souls,\" who have followed their masters into battle as thralls. Most of these individuals were broken creatures, little more conscious than the hyenas that the gnolls favored as pets, but a handful retained their intellect, effectively becoming gnolls in all but form. These kryshantel were the most dangerous since they, unlike regular gnolls, have been able to act as infiltrators, performing sabotage and laying the ground for gnoll raids, too often undetected until it was already too late.[14]Though most gnoll packs embraced their reputation for savagery, others refrained from such utter depravity. These clans were also nomadic but unlike the others rarely engaged in violent raids except when seriously provoked. Likewise, though they retained the natural gnoll bloodlust they took no joy in torture or unnecessary cruelty, embracing hunting and tracking over outright slaughter.[9]In some cases, these gnolls might have even come to befriend or at least peacefully interact with the members of other races, offering their services as trappers or hunters.[9] These races could often include bugbears, hobgoblins, ogres, orcs, and even trolls.[6] However, they generally preferred their own kind and except when on business rarely visiting neighboring villages dominated by members of another race. Likewise, these gnolls remain aggressive and quick to anger, meaning visitors should be careful not to offend.[9]Gnolls would sometimes summon demons to fight alongside them.Gnolls were most often worshipers of the demon lord Yeenoghu, who some claim created them. Though some paid only nominal reverence, many gnolls were fanatically devoted to their dark overlord, his influence having been the primary cause of their savagery. Some gnolls believed it was their purpose as Yeenoghu's servants to cleanse the weak from the world, serving a higher purpose through the slaughter they had spread.[13]In spite of their devotion to Yeenoghu, few gnolls had any interest in ritual and there were few clerics or shamans to be found among the savage packs. Typically, gnolls saw their very brutality as a sign of their devotion to the demon lord, painting the eye of Yeenoghu onto their weapons and armor and howling his name as a war cry in battle.[13]Gnolls venerated Yeenoghu by celebrating their victories with demonic rituals and blood offerings. Occasionally, Yeenoghu rewarded such a celebrant by allowing the gnoll to be possessed by a demonic spirit, marking them as one of his chosen. Such gnolls were known as fangs of Yeenoghu. Hyenas that feasted upon the slain foe of one of the Fangs were transformed into full-grown gnolls, allowing fangs to quickly increase their population.[19]A few gnolls were led, however, by warlocks who made powerful pacts with the demonic servants of Yeenoghu and guided the packs they led through frightful visions paid for with even more horrific rituals. The most terrible of these were the Corruption of the Soul Consumed, where living victims were eaten alive by female hyenas who were then swiftly impregnated with evistros or barlguras formed from the tormented souls of the dead, a conception that was followed by an even swifter birth.[13]Those gnolls who turned away from the worship of Yeenoghu often embraced no deity, seeing no clear difference between demons and gods. Sometimes these gnolls sought the patronage of fey spirits of the natural world, embracing the primal essence of nature. Others sought out the gods of other races.[13] The gnolls of back in the days of ancient Netherese went so far as to make monthly pilgrimages to a Forested Enclave of the Face of the Sun of Amaunator, worshiping any given Righteous Potentate (who had a tradition of casting continual light spells on their hair) as \"lightened ones\".[21]By 1340 DR, a tribe of gnolls took over the Cadorna Textile House in then-ruined and monster-infested Old Phlan. The tribe was led by a chieftain and his three wives.[17] Curiously enough, the chieftain was a hulking half-gnoll, an exceptionally rare breed. That creature was killed by a group of heroes of Phlan, including Shal Desanea, Ren o' the Star, and Tarl Desanea.[22]By 1362 DR Maligor, the Zulkir of Alteration in Thay amassed a significant army of gnolls that were trained by Asp attracting the attention of Harpers, other zulkirs, and neighboring countries. Maligor targeted the up and coming Red Wizard Rembert Wellford as a ploy to distract his opponent Szass Tam from the real target. The Zulkir of Alteration sent out his gnoll army to march on Rembert's territory promising the half of the land to Szass Tam who very likely was going to take the entire territory for himself before the gnoll army was to arrive.[23]",

They usually attacked by charging.[2]In Zakhara, goats were one of the most common domesticated herd animals, with some human clans claiming herds of thousands of individual goats.[3] Nomadic Jann tribes herded goats,[4] and some ogre giant clans as well.[5] Herds could be found among the many islands of Zakhara, usually tended by reef giants.[6]In eastern Calimshan, goats and sheep were the only herd animals hardy enough to survive in the harsh environment.[7] In the eastern and southeastern foothill fringes of Anauroch, goats and sheep were likewise herded by the D'tarig.[8]Several settlements on Yggdrasil kept goat herds.[9]Female goats were called does, male goats were called bucks, and juvenile goats were called kids. They lived in herds of up to two bucks and a dozen does, and twice as many kids.[2]Goats provided milk, which could be turned into goat cheese.[10] Vilksmaarg was a pungent and salty type of goat cheese made in Vilkstead and was popular in taverns along the Sword Coast.[11] Kragh is an alcoholic beverage made by cyclopskin. It is made from fermented goat's or sheep's milk.[12] The skin of a goat could be fashioned into a handy drinking vessel.[13] Goat hair could be shorn to make wool. In Zakhara, it was common practice to blend the hair from a camel and a goat while making wool.[14]Goat's meat was referred to as chevon and often was simply cooked as steaks over a campfire, seasoned with roadside herbs and pepper. Single serving of chevon was valued at three gold coins.[15]In Kara-Tur, a goat was worth up to 5 tael.[16]In Neverwinter, goat meat was one of the many common fillings used in savory pies.[17]",

Their skin color ranged from yellow through any shade of orange to a deep red,[10] though they also came in shades of green.[13] All members of the same tribe normally shared the same skin color[10]Goblins typically dressed in dark leathers soiled by poor hygiene and colored in a similar range of tones to their skin.[10][5]Like other goblinoids, goblins often had a short temper,[7] and were more easily provoked than individuals of most other races. They often found it difficult to overcome this short fuse, and had a sense of greed that made it difficult for them to act altruistically.[14] They also generally took sadistic pleasure in exacting revenge once crossed.[14]Young goblins were taught from an early age to rely only on themselves, and that to survive, they needed to be aggressive and ruthless. To a goblin, it didn't seem logical to treat others as well or better than you would treat yourself; rather, they believed in preemptively removing potential rivals before they could become a threat. Expatriated goblins would sometimes try to recreate the circumstances of their culture, preying on the weaknesses of others in non-goblin communities.[9]Despite their generally poor reputation however, not all goblins were dim-witted or evil. Some goblins have risen to become heroes, gaining enough renown to be accepted into the civilized world of other, more commonly good races. Those goblins seeking this path may have found it difficult to overcome their temper and greed, as well as the cultural influence of their brethren, but those who did often found it could be more rewarding, in the long run at least, to serve good rather than to serve evil.[14] Those that did often made use of their ill-gained talents as rogues or fighters.[7]Being bullied by bigger, stronger creatures had taught goblins to exploit what few advantages they had, namely sheer numbers and malicious ingenuity. They favored ambushes, overwhelming odds, dirty tricks, and any other edges they could devise, the concept of a fair fight being meaningless in their society.[15] They were an elusive and nimble race, which enabled them to slip away from danger more easily than most. In combat, goblins often used this advantage to sneak up on enemies and deal them a blow from hiding and then slip away before they could be retaliated against.[12]When they had superior numbers in battle, goblins would attempt to flank lone combatants.[16] Retreat or surrender was their general response to being outmatched.[15]Goblins were often known to fight with military picks, morningstars, short swords, slings, and spears.[5]Goblins were not known for having their lives valued.Goblin society was tribal by nature, generally led by the strongest (and sometimes smartest) around, who normally had access to the best weapons.[5][9] Leaders among the race often came to power through betrayal or aggression rather than by more peaceful means, or as clerics of the goblin gods. Because of the violent nature of goblin culture, it was not uncommon for goblins to come under the domination of individuals from a larger, more physically powerful culture, most typically larger goblinoids such as hobgoblins or bugbears.[7]Goblins had little concept of privacy, living and sleeping in large communal areas with only the leaders living separately in their own private chambers. As such, goblin lairs were often stinking or soiled, though easily defended when under assault[9] and layered with simple traps for such purposes.[15] The innermost chambers of goblin lairs were usually the most densely-populated and well-defended.[16] Goblin settlements were often filled with young goblin children, partially due to gender roles, though young goblins did not outnumber adults since their lives were often at least as dangerous as their forebears.[9]A pair of goblins torturing a dwarf.The gender roles of goblin society had the dominant males sustain the community through raiding and stealing, sneaking into lairs, villages, and even towns by night to take what they could (and if supplies ran short they were willing to eat sentients, including each other).[9] Goblin females meanwhile were expected to birth as many children as possible to sustain a population constantly driven down by violence. Many goblins who left for a life among other races were females, driven away by the rigidly structured role they were expected to play.[9]Some goblin tribes were not above waylaying travelers on the road or in forests and stripping them of their possessions.[17] Goblins sometimes captured slaves to perform hard labor in the tribe's lair or camp.[5][18]Goblins often inhabitated temperate plains,[3] though many were also known to live in caverns or underground.[5]Besides the Ghukliak,[10] some goblins were known to be capable of speaking Orcish or Yipyak.[5]Goblins primarily worshiped members of the goblinoid pantheon, such as Maglubiyet in particular, who inspired them with his feats of strength and treachery.[6] Following the Spellplague and prior to the Second Sundering, however, the power of the Black Lord Bane grew and extended his power over Maglubiyet, making the goblin god one of his exarchs.[19] Following the Second Sundering, goblins again worshiped deities such as Maglubiyet and Khurgorbaeyag.[20]Goblins were often considered little more than a nuisance.[10] They did not get along well with most other races and were particularly suspicious of other goblinoids. Goblins had a somewhat ambivalent relationship with orcs and half-orcs, whom they'd work with on occasion, but the only true allies of the goblin race were worgs, who often acted as mounts and fighting companions for goblins.[6]Goblins had particularly adverse relations with dwarves, gnomes,[5] and Tel-quessir.[6]Some were known to domesticate huge wolves.[6]Goblins bred extremely rapidly compared with many other races, accounting for their large population.[21]",

        "description": "Gorgons had an animal level of intelligence.[5] They were very aggressive creatures that attacked intruders on sight, attempting to trample or gore them or by breathing out a cone of green vapor that turned them into stone. There was no way to calm them as they were impossible to domesticate. They were also unable to swim.[6] Once a potential threat was petrified a gorgon would instinctively ignore the body.[7]The petrifying green vapor that gorgons exuded from their mouths somehow existed simultaneously on the material, astral, and ethereal planes.[5][8] Some believed that their awareness even extended to the latter two planes.[5] When exuded by a young gorgon, the size of that cloud was only half that of their adult counterparts.[8]This vapor was produced and stored in an internal organ that opened into the roof of their mouth. This organ would continue to function hours after a gorgon was killed. By the 14th century DR, scholars still had yet to uncover how it functioned.[7] However, it was known that these vapors had no effect underwater and that they could easily be dissipated by an air elemental or similar force of moving air, such as by the gust of wind spell.[9]The irregularly shaped scales that covered a gorgon were composed of impure iron and coated in a waxy substance that helped to prevent them from rusting. This substance was perpetually exuded from cartilaginous seams between the scales. If a scale somehow succumbed to intense rusting it would fall off the body - this left the gorgon vulnerable, since they were incapable of growing new ones.[9]This regional breed of gorgons had a special ability, which some said was granted by the deities of the Hexad. If they slipped into the river, they turned to stone and were saved from drowning because they no longer needed oxygen or food. Sometimes, these petrified gorgons might be washed onto the shore by a strong current and the sun would warm them, causing them to be restored to their normal form. It was not unknown for fishermen to pull the petrified gorgons out of the river, thinking them to be statues.[6]Gorgons were omnivorous creatures that required a lot of iron in their diet to maintain the durability of their scales. This was often obtained from blood and green vegetation.[8]Gorgons loved to eat fish. The Cormanthor gorgons flocked to the banks of River Ashaba and Elvenflow each spring when they flooded, so that they could collect the fish that were stranded there. Once the supply was depleted, a few of the gorgons were tempted to venture into the river to get more. Some of them fell in as a result, but their special ability could save them (see Species, Cormanthor below).[6]They were also known to have a fondness for deer and elk.[4]These creatures were typically found to live underground[5] or in plains in regions with a temperate[3] or tropical climate.[4] Many preferred to live in wilderness that was relatively secure and free of danger.[5]The blood of a gorgon was a magical component used in masonry to prevent magical travel through walls. When one drop of blood was mixed with a pint of water during the mixture of stucco or mortar and applied with no unaffected areas larger than a man's head, it would prevent astral and ethereal travel through walls.[10][11]Drow in Old Shanatar used gorgon blood as an ingredient in forging gorgon plate mail, an armor said to be capable of protecting them against the sun's harmful affects.[12]Their metallic scales could be used to make ink for scrolls of protection from petrification or fashioned into a set of scale mail that protected against petrification effects.[4]Gorgon milk was one of the ingredients in creating the hag treat known as \"Eye Scream\", along with newt eyes, blueberries, and swamp water. The recipe was detailed in the Witch's Brew Cookbook.[13]",

However, they were vulnerable any form of lightning.[5][7] They also had the ability of Blindsight.[8]When one of these creatures reached an exceptionally large they would develop latent psionics, allowing them to unleash a psychic crush, but in return be left vulnerable to retaliation. They were only known to unleash this ability whenever a creature within 6\u202ffeet (1.8\u202fmeters) of them used psionic powers.[5] It was suggested that gray oozes developed these psionic abilities having evolved to live near Mind flayers.[9]Gray oozes were known to attack in groups, dissolving enemies and absorbing their bones as slime to grow.[2] It attacked by striking until its prey was either dead or unconscious, moving on top of them afterwards to digest them from within. Gray oozes were particularly feared for the fact that they were transparent. This made them difficult to detect while they were still or moving slowly.[3]Acidic secretions of the gray ooze corroded metal at an alarming rate[3]; as a result, blacksmiths also sometimes used jarred gray oozes to meld ore into the right shape.[10]Gray oozes were known to be found in subterranean areas, such as caverns and dungeons. They were mindless scavengers who dragged themselves around caves or sewers, while absorbing and digesting whatever they came across.[6][5] Unlike other oozes, the gray variety couldn't move on ceilings or walls, hence it was left to slide its way along subterranean floors.[11][6]In the Abyss, gray oozes could be found in Shedaklah, the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss.[12]",

        "description": "Green dragons were most notable for the large, waving crest or fin that started at the dragon's nose and ran the entire length of the dragon's body. They also had exceptionally long, slender forked tongues.[citation needed]AD5 Things You Should Never Do With Your Money, According to ExpertsBy The Penny HoarderA review of green dragon anatomy.These dragons were known to have very bad tempers and a tendency for evil behavior.[6] They loved intrigue and secrets. They put up a front of diplomacy and deceit when dealing with stronger foes, but they revealed their cruel and petty nature when intimidating lesser beings or when gaining the upper hand. They delighted in stalking their enemies and listening in for any information they could gather before moving to attack. Green dragons especially enjoyed corrupting or consuming elves and fey creatures.[citation needed]Beyond fighting with their massive jaws and claws, these dragons were capable of expelling a cone of poisonous chlorine gas.[6]Green dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and their appearance was considered a good omen by his followers.[7]Green dragons valued their territory, but only as a means to gain as much power as possible without expending considerable effort. They would sometimes trade safe passage for a worthy item to add to their hoards. Even so, they were extremely cunning and duplicitous foes, and loved double-crossing others. A traveler who stumbled into a green dragon's territory might be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but more often than not the dragon would pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard was down. Worse, if the traveler impressed the green dragon during its stay, they might start thinking of the newcomer as a prized possession to be corrupted and sculpted to its will.[citation needed]The typical green dragon lair was located underground[6] and was a complex of caves and tunnels, with its main entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The preferred green dragon lair was a cave high up on a cliff, but such locations were usually hard to find and thus only home to the oldest and most powerful green dragons.[citation needed]These dragons were typically found to live near woodlands.[6]A green dragon wyrmling.Green dragons were reasonably good parents, with both mother and father typically staying close to their eggs while they were incubating. Green dragon females either kept their eggs in a solution of acid or buried them in leaves moistened with rainwater. The green wyrmling was easily mistaken for a black, due to their nearly black scales. As the wyrmling matured, its scales became steadily lighter in color until they reached the striking green shade of an adult. The wyrmlings typically stayed with both parents until they reached adulthood (approximately 100 years).[citation needed]One of the ways of creating a wand of stinking cloud was using a horn of an old green dragon.[8]Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap",

        "description": "Of all the hags, green hags were the least physically menacing, their resemblance to regular humans serving to make them more unnerving than imposing. Though their typical bodily figure was that of a withered and hunched female, they could run the entire spectrum of body types and stretch into the extremes of both ends, some being skeletally gaunt and others morbidly obese.[7]Without certain indicators, green hags would simply appear as human crones, but even then their skilled use of illusory disguises could hide these tell-tale signs.[7] If not magically camouflaging their true forms, the most obvious feature of a green hag, as the name implied, was the pallid green color of their rough, bark-like skin.[4] Knobby, cancerous protrusions often marked their flesh,[7] some hidden by the ragged peasant rags they typically wore.[5][6]A green hag's visage was normally blemished with warts and exaggerated facial features and ringed by a tangled mane of vine-like hair,[7][3] ranging in color somewhere between moldy olive green and a near-black shade of dark.[7][4] Below their eyes, either orange or amber colored,[4] were needle-sharp fangs as pointed as their claws, black or yellow talons covered in filth that grew from typically slender fingers.[7][6]Tragedy was the greatest delight of the green hags, the act of dashing hope and replacing it with despair bringing them no small amount of glee.[1][9] This was because out of all the hags, a cruel race with a natural need for misery and murder, green hags were the ones driven most strongly by hate. The pure, unbridled malice of green hags was unrivaled by that of their sister subraces; dreams of destruction dominated their thoughts and they showed an apathy to suffering on par with that of a predator.[1][7]A green hag dancing with another in the guise of beauty.Though the original source of this hate was a matter of rumors, perhaps some racial spite or long-forgotten grudge, the ultimate target was clear.[7][10] In short, green hags ultimately desired the downfall of society, to bring down all nations and replace that which was civilized, beautiful, and pure with a recreation of the moral bankruptcy of nature at its most brutal, just as they preferred it. However, assuming that because their end goal was to inspire savagery would mean that their methods were wild and simplistic would be a fatal mistake.[7]Although not necessarily smarter than other hags, and they were highly knowledgeable, green hags were certainly the most cunning and duplicitous, outmatching the other subraces in their ability to tempt, persuade and manipulate,[7][10] and doing so happily from behind webs of lies and secret intentions.[1] Even the most basic plots of the green hags were devious, involving the use of their particular abilities to lure travelers to specific places in their swamps for some nefarious purpose. They could mimic cries for help or fearsome noises depending on where they wanted their victims to go, and that was for their simpler schemes.[1]They were also known to eagerly transform themselves into local legends to lure in those curious about such things, creating gossip about wise women of the wilds or fair fey of the forest to set their traps. For example, they would seduce others into secluded locations under guises of beauty, and though they didn't exclusively use this trick on men, they generally found it worked easier on them. Only after getting their partners there would they sadistically reveal the deception, either before the encounter began, in which case they slaughtered and consumed them, or, debatably the crueler choice, after it had ended, leaving most survivors traumatized to the point of madness.[1]The green hag's true form is revealed, and her partner is none the wiser.While unarguably terrible, such small-scale schemes were less favorable to green hags than more grand machinations. They beguiled themselves into powerful authority positions, such as the lovers of leaders or the idols of savage humanoid tribes, pulling them deeper into depravity by encouraging profane acts. Despite their wickedness and hateful personalities, green hags were actually the least xenophobic of hags, willing to reason with others and cooperate with those of similar mindset, even withstanding their natural sense of superiority to others.[7] Despite their egotism however, green hags were also cautious, possibly to the point of being considered craven, going so far as to not leave their lairs if not invisible to avoid being seen. They played with weaker prey before consuming it but fled from any strong and determined opposition, effectively acting as conspiratorial bullies towards any being they could.[6]Green hags were reported to have several spell-like abilities used to mislead, such as dancing lights, ghost sound and more utility based powers like speak with monsters and water breathing. They could also disguise themselves, their clothes and their possessions to appear as anything else of similar shape, such as the form of a young woman or elderly lady or the form of an individual they had seen before. If disguises weren't enough, they could render themselves invisible and incapable of being tracked or manipulate their prey unseen by mimicking the noises of humans and animals, although manufactured sounds and the depths of speech were typically beyond their capabilities.[3][1][7][2]A green hag can easily overpower most ordinary men.Like all hags, the strength behind a green hag's frail physique was not to be underestimated, for not only were they resistant to magic but their calloused flesh made them resistant to physical attacks and their hardiness extended to their flesh-rending claws. Even worse, it was said that a green hag's touch could sap strength with even the slightest brush, quickly leaving formidable warriors who couldn't resist the vigor-draining power helpless against them.[3][1][7] If unwilling to personally deal with situations they were also reported to be able to manipulate the swamp, causing roots to grasp at trespassers and causing miasmas to rise from the earth.[2]The green hag druid Gathra and her tyrannosaurus animal companion GyrnthraxLike in their schemes, green hags were cowardly creatures who fought only that which they could certainly defeat and who took precautions to ensure victory, such as only striking on moonless nights to exploit their darkvision.[3][6] Before combat, they often used some combination of mimicry and illusions to make their prey stray from their pack or walk into an area where they would be vulnerable, sometimes kidnapping and killing pets to gain a wider variety of sounds before luring in their unwary owners with imitated cries.[7][6] They were ambush predators that shunned fair fights in favor of lying in wait for their prey to enter a given location, either invisible, using their natural camouflage, or some other manner of disguise. Helpless victims were toyed with like a cat playing with a mouse, sometimes with a mocking use of mimicry.[6]Green hags frequently engaged in, and often took advantage of, the tactic of drowning their foes, using their ability to breathe underwater and steal strength to leave victims incapable of fighting back before dragging them in. Every stagnant pool of water could be the hiding place of a green hag just waiting for a passing traveler or fisherman to come by. The terrified soul would quickly drown unless the hag decided to take them back to their lairs for some magical or, if the victim was extremely unfortunate, carnal process.[7]Though a strong and determined opposition would force them to flee, green hags were the most likely of the hags to undergo training, learning the combat skills of fighters or barbarians, the arcane magic of sorcerers or wizards, or the divine magic of clerics or druids.[7][11]As the most tolerant of hags, green hags were capable infiltrating the humanoid civilizations that they wished to terrorize and destroy,[7] even occasionally joining adventuring parties to complete their goals.[11] They could and did blend into urban settlements more frequently and efficiently than other hags, sometimes hunting their prey directly in their homes rather than in their own environments. Covens of green hags, including covens including other types and covens exclusively of their own kind, were formed far more regularly than those of other hags.[7]A green hag in her lairOutside of their own race, they were known to have affinity with the alien malice of the will-o'-wisps, put aside their spite to ally with evil druids,[7] and deal with the less intelligent creatures like ogres and hill giants to obtain information, food, and protection in exchange for random trinkets they stole from their victims.[6] Regardless, any green hag partnership, whether framed as an alliance or master-servant relationship and possibly with the green hag in the servant role, lasted only until the hag stopped benefiting or could take control.[7]Green hags were known to live in twisted trees,[2] underwater caverns and caves concealed by foliage or boulders, sometimes warrens of their own creation. Those in urban environments were known to dwell in slums or hide underground inside sewers.[7][6][5] Powerful green hags, such as grandmas or aunties, corrupted the region around their layers in sinister ways; the plants would form a twisted thicket, the fetid swamp mud would grow thicker, trees could awaken and attack hostile intruders, and sometimes illusory duplicates of the hag would appear at random, allowing them to interact with others from behind the illusion. Within such a hag's lair the illusions would become more deliberately made and tangible, capable of interacting with the environment but still incapable of causing physical harm.[9]Green hags spoke a dialect of the language that annis hags spoke and were known to speak Common, Elven, Sylvan, Draconic Giant, Jogishk, and various demihuman languages.[1][3][4]Green hags made their homes in wet, temperate environments, gloomy and isolated regions like dark swamps, dying forests and misty marshes where they could take full advantage of their abilities.[1][3][11] Countrysides and desolate areas of civilization would also suffice, but they typically chose spots near bodies of water such as rivers.[4][11] Their acute senses, including superior sight, smell, and hearing, along with their coloration and ability to move silently through the swamp, made them dangerous predators without their cunning and magic.[4] Poison was an ineffective deterrent against them and they would eat practically anything that moved with humanoid flesh being favored.[2][6]Green hags were said to be the longest-living hags, assuming hags weren't entirely ageless, persisting for centuries longer than other hags, possibly because of their arboreal flesh or just greater vitality.[1][7][4] They were believed to be relatives of night hags and annis hags, with there potentially being some ancestral link between them all, although this wasn't certain.[10][6]Green hags were found in Ashanath, the North Country, the Forest of Lethyr, and the Yuirwood in the Unapproachable East.[12]There was known to be a unique creation myth in regards to the green hags, one that stood out given that it was told by dozens of races with little change. Most commonly referred to as Green Mary, but known by elves as Kiersana the Unfaithful and to orcs as Grigga Toegnawer, her story sent shivers down the spines of the children of all races. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful druid of the woodlands known as Green Mary who protected the hundreds of miles of wilderness that was her domain. She dwelt in the heart of the forest worshiping nature spirits and upholding their ancient laws in a symbiotic relationship of servitude and protection with the wildlife, until one day a powerful hunter arrived. He chopped down trees to make weapons in order to hunt the animals for sport, and the whispers of the forest sought vengeance against him for his recklessness, yet both Mary and the hunter became enraptured by each other's beauty, leading her to disobey its commands.[7]The following morning, Mary awoke to find that as punishment, the forest had warped her form into something more resembling the forest she was meant to be protecting, leading her to fearfully and repentantly slay her horrified lover, leaving not even a drop of his blood to stain the earth. Yet despite her penance, nature showed its merciless side to Mary and left her in her disfigured and self-loathing state, leading her to flee into the most fetid fen of the forest in misery. Thus, Green Mary became the first green hag, a creature that lusted after humanoids while craving their destruction and whose dalliances with the civilized world at the protest of nature made her a pariah of the latter and the archenemy of the former.[7]The green hag, Nanny Pu'pu.",

Including the length of the tentacles, this made a grick about 8\u202fft (2.4\u202fm) long.[3] A grick's head featured a pair of tiny eyes[2] and a snapping beak surrounded by large barbed tentacles. The tentacles would cover the beak unless the grick was attacking or eating.[1]Grick skin was rubbery and uniformly dark with with pale underbellies.[3] Colouration varied from dark greens[3][1] to blues[2][4] .Their skin would camouflage well in rocky terrain and shadows.[1]Gricks were almost always hungry[2] and would seek to hunt anything that moves (except other gricks)[1]. Gricks would also immediately attack whenever their nest was threatened.[2]Gricks were adept at climbing and could slither up walls with little difficulty.[3] Although they prefer to stay underground or indoors, gricks would venture into the open if food was scarce. Even then, gricks would only do so at night to avoid burning their small and sensitive eyes.[2]Gricks preferred to hunt in packs but could also be found hunting alone.[2] Gricks hunted by waiting in busy areas and ambushing their prey.[3] Gricks used their natural camoflage to remain hidden in rocky terrain.[1]If hunting in a pack, gricks would manoeuvre to outflank their pray wherever possible.[2]. Due to their relatively small beaks, gricks could only take small bites of food. As a result gricks preferred to drag prey back to their nest once it was unconscious or dead.[3]Gricks laid oblong blue/green eggs about the size of a human fist.[5] Young gricks were known as grick wormlings.[6] Grick wormlings were edible and were known to be served in the Dalelands stuffed with rice pilaf and diced celery.[6] Cured and spiced grick tentacles were also eaten.[7]Gricks could be made to serve abberrant creatures[2] like grells.[8]Due to the grick's constant need to eat, some explorers consider the best way to kill a grick is to seal it inside its nest and wait for it to starve to death.[1]In -8170 DR the settlement of Alatorin was defended by gricks.[9]At some point after 1372 DR the sewers of Waterdeep were home to a small population of gricks.[10]One of the circle of fangs rings was found on a chain around the neck of a drowned grick.[11]At some point prior to 1479 DR, the ruins of Harpshield Castle were infested with numerous gricks.[12]In 1491 DR,[note 1] a goblin named Lhupo kept a pet grick in Cragmaw Castle.[13]",

An adult griffon was about 8\u202ffeet (2.4\u202fmeters) long, with a wingspan of 25\u202ffeet (7.6\u202fmeters). The average griffon weighed about 500\u202flb (230,000\u202fg).[3] Expectedly, griffons, and their lairs exuded a mix of two smells: a musky odor of great cats and the scent of falconer's mews.[6]Griffons were known to be somewhat intelligent creatures, though had a penchant for aggression. Young griffons were generally not combative.[3][5]Young griffons were known as fledglings.[5]Griffons were carnivorous creatures. Their favorite animal to prey upon was horses. They would often attack them when within sight or smelling distance.[5]Griffons typically made their nests in homes in high rocky places like cliffs,[5] as well as open caverns set in hills and mountain regions.[7]When acquainted with humans, they were usually stabled in airy, doorless stone halls, vaguely resembling their lairs.[7]In the Unapproachable East, they nested at the highest reaches of the Tannath mountains and Umbergoth.[8] They could also be found around the coastal regions and interior uplands of Aglarond.[9]When tamed and raised at a young age they could become very loyal and fierce mounts. Because of this they were highly sought after, with eggs fetching prices of around 2,000 gp and fledglings for around 5,000 gp.[5]Griffons were commonly found as mounts throughout the Realms.

        "description": "Grimlocks were a humanoid race of creatures with slightly scaled, thick gray skin that was usually scarred from hunts through their constricted underground passageways. Those with a special status in their society often had decorative designs scarred into their skin[8] They had sharp teeth and typically black hair. This often grew to be long and unkempt.[6][5][9] Many had long claw-like nails.[10] Some were said to have completely white eyes,[5][9] while other accounts told of their faces being devoid of eyes, instead having skin stretching across where their eye sockets should be.[1][8][note 1]Grimlocks typically wore little clothing or armor, though some were known to sport tanned leather belts and harnesses, as well as decorative bracers.[8]Grimlocks were very blunt and suspicious of other creatures. Those who wandered away from their kin often experienced culture shock, but felt some sense of gratification at how strange things were. These wanderers were also known to be capable of overcoming their xenophobic leanings, viewing each individual they meet as a potential pack member. Though this mindset needed to be reinforced through daily meditation.[8]Though grimlocks were prone to evil acts, their intent was rarely malicious. Rather, their behavior was rooted in a deep sense of self-preservation and struggle for survival.[8]A battle-ready warrior grimlock.Grimlocks were well-adapted for combat thanks to their naturally hardy bodies and high sensory awareness of their surroundings. However, they were typically very unorganized in battle. They were poor targets of subjugation in efforts to form an enthralled fighting force as well, due to their fear of foreign races.[7]At times they sought to attack their enemies under the cover of darkness, hoping to take advantage of their blind senses and prey on foes while they are disoriented.[11]They typically shunned ranged weaponry, preferring to act like barbarians and fight their foes up close with crude stone battleaxes[4] or weapons made of bone.[12]Grimlocks ate any raw flesh they could find - especially that of humans. Because of this, their populations were often decimated from feasting upon diseased meat.[7]Grimlocks typically had two names, a pack name and personal name, with the latter derived from some element of their underground habitats.[8]Many wild grimlocks were born in an extended series of caves that they called the Fingerhome. The caverns of the Fingerhome extended throughout the upper, middle, and lower Underdark.[8]One prominent aspect of grimlock society was the \"hunt-bond,\" a vow of mutual respect and protection that every grimlock with one or more creatures (usually other grimlocks). Those hunt-bonded with a grimlock were considered its closest friend(s) and the creature would do anything to protect them.[8]In the Underdark of Faer\u00fbn, some groups of grimlocks worshiped individual medusae, considering them as minor deities. The power of a medusa's gaze was beyond the grimlock's ability to comprehend (as they were blind), so it seemed divine to them. More enlightened grimlocks, however, tended to worship Shar, the goddess of darkness.[8] And some grimlocks were known to worship illithids.[1]The language of the grimlocks was a dialect of terran and undercommon. Some chose to learn abyssal and other evil tongues in order to gain power for themselves by making sinister deals.[8]A pair of grimlocks assault a goliath at the behest of their drow masters.Grimlocks were extremely xenophobic and preferred to keep to themselves.[5][7] This was due to their history of being frequently raided by both mind flayers and drow for slave fodder,[8][12] subjected to extreme depravity by aboleths, and their mushroom fields razed and water cisterns drained by drow. This latter act often left grimlocks starving and desperate for food, forcing them to raid surface communities in order to survive.[8]Some grimlocks were known to do work for other races as ambushers of Underdark caravans or as looters of ancient ruins.[8]Some sources claimed that the grimlocks were the descendants of humans of Uthgardt ancestry from the Golden Eagle and Red Pony tribes. Long ago, in 576 DR (the Year of the Sunless Passage), these barbarian tribes vanished into the Underdark by way of a passage that leads down from beneath One Stone, the Uthgardt ancestor mound located in the easternmost Moonwood. After years of wandering in the lightless passages of the Underdark, these barbarians evolved to become the grimlocks. They retained twisted vestiges of their ancient traditions, including a depraved form of ancestor worship that involved consumption of the aged and weak while they still lived.[13][14]Other sources claimed that the grimlocks were descents of cannibal cults, from the days of the Illithid's empire, who had fled into the Underdark following the empire's collapse.[1]One tribe of grimlocks resided in the Cavern of Cloven Heads, a small cave that five thousand years prior was the site of a battle between a rear guard of dwarves of Clan Black Axe and a group of drow refugees led by Menzoberra the Kinless (the Lolthite priestess who founded Menzoberranzan). This tribe abandoned their nomadic ways and settled the surrounding caverns. Within the Cavern of Cloven Heads lay a monstrous boulder engraved with runes. Surrounding the boulder are the riven skulls of hundreds of drow. This discovery matched fragmentary legends regarding the grimlocks' lost ancestor mound, so they now revere this mound as such. This mound was actually an ancient dwarven cairn of the Black Axe Clan. The inscriptions on the boulder were Dethek runes that related the legend of the \"Brave Beards.\" The rock itself lay atop the spot where the last defender of the dwarven rear guard, Dorn Black Axe, literally sank into the floor of the cavern.[13]Additional communities of grimlocks were found beneath the Storm Horns and Thunder Peaks within Cormyr,[7] as well as on the Sargauth Level of Undermountain.[15][16]",

        "description": "      A harpy had the upper body of a female humanoid and the lower body of an reptilian creature, with scaly legs, clawed feet, and clawed hands with knotty fingers. Harpies had coal-black eyes in faces like cruel old women, with hair that was filthy, tangled, and crusted with old dry blood. They possessed powerful leathery wings with which they could fly and carry away their victims.[3][note 1] Harpies did not wear any clothing,[3] but would adorn themselves with jewelry or trinkets from their victims.[6] There was no physical difference between male and female harpies. The males possessed breasts just like the females did, leading to the misconception that male harpies did not exist.[7] Harpies were notoriously malevolent and sadistic, taking enormous joy in hurting, torturing and killing their victims, and were always seeking more. They were fond of entrancing travelers with their songs and luring them to shockingly cruel dooms. When they were done playing with their captives, they slew them and finally devoured them.[3] They were not particularly intelligent creatures, and were prone to cowardice in the face of superior power.[7] The deadliest power of the harpy was its insidious and captivating song. A harpy's song, while it was heard, acted like a charm affecting all non-harpies up to 300 feet (90 meters) away. It took an effort to will to resist; those who did could count themselves safe for a day, at least from that one harpy's song. In those who succumbed, it induced a trance-like state in which the victim was compelled to move directly towards the harpy. If dangers obstructed their path, they could shake off the effect, but if they could not, they could do little but try to protect themselves. However, once within reach of the harpy, the victim was at the harpy's mercy and made no attempt at defending themselves. Creatures who could not hear were unaffected by the magical song.[3][6] Elves were naturally resistant to the effects of the harpy's song.[7] They had keen hearing and skills in deceit, intimidation, and, curiously, oratory.[3] Harpies used primitive weapons, usually big bones wielded as improvised clubs, but a few harpy archers mastered the use of bows.[3] Otherwise, they could also bite[6] and attack with their claws.[6][3] They often attacked on the wing, striking with their weapons.[3] They had no preference over their victims, and enjoyed the killing and torture of any creature.[6] Female harpies could lay as many as twenty eggs at will from the age of two, but only around three of those would successfully hatch, and any deformed young were killed by a parent.[7] It was unclear whether harpies looked after their young or not, but if they did, it consisted of nothing more than feeding their young, similar to birds.[6][note 2] The lifespan of a harpy was up to 50 years, but most died around 25\u201330 years.[6][7][note 3] When old age weakened a harpy, it was killed by its kin.[7] They were almost exclusively carnivorous, but if meat was unavailable, they would resort to eating vegetation. Their preferred food was fresh demihuman meat, especially elves. Due to the natural resistance elves had to the harpy's song, harpies viewed their meat as an especially rare delicacy.[7] Harpies made homes in groups of six or more individuals within marshlands or in caves near shorelines, which were preferably near well-traveled routes.[6] They were often encountered alone, in pairs, or in packs of seven to a dozen harpies known as \"flights\".[3] However, a tribe of harpies, known as a \"scream\", could be as large as two hundred.[7] There was no social structure to harpy life. There was constant quarreling, which sometimes resulted in fights to the death. When deaths did occur, harpies were willing to eat their own kind. Otherwise, harpies ventured out to hunt, and their victims were often brought back to the lair to be killed and eaten.[6] Harpies were generally uninterested in treasure or wealth, but they would always take at least one possession from a victim back to their lair as a symbol of their kill.[7] A few successful harpies took up the bow as archers, mastering this tactic and going at it alone as cruel hunters, bandits, and mercenaries, usually operating as bandits when not hired as mercenaries. Such harpies acquired much wealth in the form of the tools of their trade.[3] It was not unknown for harpies to cooperate with other evil humanoids if it served their interests.[6] A harpy attacking a villager in Vanesci Hamlet. Harpies with long tails were known to dwell in and around the Kingdom of Nix, a goblin realm that lay upon the high Forbidden Plateau in the Utter East,[8] beside a glacier in the Wu Pi Te Shao Mountains of the Yehimal.[8][9][10] The harpies of Nix were known to be merciless hunters.[8] Harpies were also known to be in the many forests and jungles of Maztica.[11] Harpies living within the Kingdom of Nix were instrumental in Redfang the Reaper's reign of terror over Vanesci Hamlet in the 7th century DR. Swooping down from high in the skies they would kidnap villagers in nets, carrying them away and eventually dropping them into the cauldrons of Nix. The demise of their hapless victims produced a burst of mana that powered the kingdom's bloodforges.[8]",

The markings on their bodies as well and their fangs and tongues were the color of soot, and they reeked of sulfurous smoke.[4][5] Nessian breeds always coal-black fur and were typically equipped with infernal chainmail shirts.[3] Hell hounds, being intelligent beasts of law, could be trained and commanded by various entities across the planes, but their inherent malice limited their versatility.[1] Outside of retrieving specific objects, hell hounds could only be trained to kill, abandoning or betraying masters that forbade them from sating their merciless hunger.[1][4] Even if not specifically trained, they stole items from their deceased victims to use as playthings, such as noisy bags or pouches containing a victim's treasures, toying with them until the flammable components eventually turned to ash and the remains littered their dens.[4] Hell hounds were capable of breathing out a stream of scorching fire from their mouths.[5] Hellhounds were very stealthy creatures[5] and unlike ordinary dogs they did not howl when hunting, instead quietly stalking their prey and surrounding them in a ring.[4] One or two hell hounds would immediately use their scorching hot breath to drive their quarry into the waiting, fiery fangs of the other pack members, unafraid of harming their other infernal companions.[2][3] Cunning and efficient, they targeted the weakest of prey, slowly surrounding those that refused to retreat. They only bayed when in the determined pursuit of fleeing victims, creating a hollow and frightening tone.[1][3][4] Hell hound packs could be as small as a pair or contain up to twenty of the vicious beasts. The largest and strongest hell hound became leader and drove off any competitors, forcing them to establish their own packs and territories. Territories were somewhere between 5-14 miles centered on their dens and could overlap with one another.[4] A Nessian warhound guarding Lord Asmodeus. Although they had difficulty mating on the Prime Material Plane, many wicked beings bred indigenous populations.[3][4] Summoned hell hounds had a tendency to escape into the wild and even those domesticated as puppies had a small chance of going rogue later in life.[4] Azers were known to use them as faithful pets but fire giants and devils in particular were known for their use of the infernal beasts.[1][3][4] Appreciated and favored for their keen senses, fire giants used hell hounds as watch dogs and bred their own populations millennia ago to create an instinctively loyal breed. Having been artificially selected for size and skill, firebred hell hounds were far more powerful and utilized more cautious tactics, able to charge up an even more dangerous version of their fire breath that they saved for when surrounded.[2][4] The archdevils kept their own kennels of hell hounds and Asmodeus himself kept his own fearsome breed, the Nessian warhounds, under his palace.[3] Mephistopheles managed to outdo his master in this, having his surgeons breed the tougher, meaner, larger and more fiery pit hounds in the ironically frigid Cania.[7] The dietary needs of hell hounds were similar to those of ordinary canines and they would consume anything that appeared edible. The flesh they consumed fed the fires within them and they only occasionally brought food back to their dens for later consumption, preferring to eat at the site of the hunt.[1][4] It was practically impossible to avoid detection from a hell hound, as their vision was sharp enough that they spot those in hiding or invisible half of the time. Their excellent olfactory senses made them capable trackers and their hearing made them incredibly difficult to sneak up on.[3][4][5] They were also known to have a keen sense of hearing.[5] Hell hound puppies were born in litters of 2-8 and newborns were only a tenth the size of adults. They slowly grew to adult size over the course of one and a half years, gaining the burning bite of their parents after two months that gradually rose to full power as they aged. At least once each day they burped an uncontrolled burst of harmless flames, which had a tendency to ignite flammable objects nearby.[4] A hell hound's inner flame engulfed them upon death, resulting in an eruption of ember and smoke at the end of which left only burnt, black scraps of fur.[1] Hell hounds were not native to the Material Plane, instead having been brought there by a plethora of evil entities for various uses, namely hunting or guarding.[2][4][5] Though despite their infernal appearance earning them association with the Nine Hells, hell hounds did not originate from Baator either. Primordials originally created them eons ago, hence why they could be found on the Plane of Fire.[2][8] Some were known to migrate to the Material Plane using portals found there, such as from the Peaks of Flame in Chult.[9] Since then, hell hounds could be primarily located on Acheron's battlefields and across the rest of the lower planes.[1] They inhabited areas known for their fiery landscapes, from barren mountains, to scorching deserts to blazing caverns from Hell to the Abyss.[2][10] On the Material Plane they were invasive beings that caused more forest fires than any other creatures excluding humanoids due to their hunting tactics.[4] Timoth and Onyx find that a hell hound's bark is worse than its bite. During the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, a pair of hell hounds were summoned at the House of the Moon, a temple of Sel\u00fbne in Waterdeep, while a false avatar of the goddess resided there (in fact Shar). High Priestess Naneatha Suaril left the hell hounds to attack Onyx and Timoth when they were caught infiltrating the place, but they slew the beasts and carried on.[13] Other Fiends\nAchaierai \u2022 Barghest \u2022 Canomorph (Haraknin \u2022 Shadurakul) \u2022 Hell hound \u2022 Hordling \u2022 Howler \u2022 Larva \u2022 Maelephant \u2022 Marrashi \u2022 Night hag \u2022 Nightmare \u2022 Rakshasa \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Vargouille \u2022 Yeth hound",

        "description": "      Hezrous were large demonic monstrosities that stood 8\u202fft (2.4\u202fm) tall and weighed 750\u202flb (340\u202fkg). They bore a superficial resemblance to a toad in humanoid form, with arms and hands instead of forelegs. Within their wide maws were rows of blunt teeth that had a powerful crushing force, and a series of long spikes ran down their backs.[3][10] Hezrous could walk on either two feet or on hands and feet, but always fought standing upright.[3][4] AD 5 Things You Should Never Do With Your Money, According to Experts By The Penny Hoarder Hezrous were obedient and simple, yet dangerously powerful beings, and as such were among the dominant monsters within the Abyss. A hezrou's main motivating factor was food, followed by a desire for wanton destruction. They gladly served under more powerful demons or even summoners who supported their behavior.[2] Their love of combat surpassed that of vrocks and the two possessed similar eating habits.[5][3] Despite their love for fighting, hezrous were not opposed to diplomacy, even with mortals, and might engage in trade when carrying cargo such as slaves.[11] Hezrous were not particularly intelligent, intuitive, or otherwise mentally capable, a fact that was seen as a virtue by their masters as scheming was not their job,[4] but they were capable of organizing underlings.[12] Unfortunately for those under their thumb, hezrous were still demons through and through, beating up on even loyal subordinates for fun and just being generally foul-tempered.[4] A hezrou's amphibian skin exuded a toxic substance that produced a cloud of noxious gas when they were agitated while their own olfactory senses were quite sharp.[4] They were somewhat ineffective against non-demonic beings, as many of their abilities didn't work against evil outsiders. They had access to many spell-like abilities, including blasphemy, unholy blight, and chaos hammer.[3] Normal demonic resistances, immunity to non-magical weapons, telepathy, and summoning, particularly of dretch mobs and other hezrou, were also among their powers.[1][4] A hezrou fighting off adventurers. Hezrous were cunning on the battlefield and could fulfill roles as both powerful warriors and capable sergeants.[3] In battle, they were often responsible for keeping the dretch mobs moving towards the enemy, but the most dangerous hordes had hezrou themselves as the rank-and-file. Once the dretches were fighting, the hezrous followed in their wake.[13] When against non-evil entities, hezrous opened combat by casting blasphemy, and then favored chaos hammer or unholy blight from time to time as suited their foes.[3] Against enemy armies, they attempted to punch holes in the opposing line with unholy blight or chaos hammer,[13] gladly forcing their way into and behind enemy ranks. There, a hezrou's foul stench could overwhelm as many (and as early) as possible, and they would be free to rip into their opponents with tooth and claw,[3] although they might accidentally take out an allied, low-ranking fiend in their wild rampage.[13] A hezrou slaver whipping various fiends into line. Hezrous were integral to both the Blood War and the day-to-day proceedings of the Abyss in general. At their core, hezrous functioned as enforcers, either as sturdy foot soldiers or solid sergeants.[12] Their ability to focus on simple tasks, oversee armies, lack of plotting skill, and great numbers made them ideal for their duties. They normally patrolled the abyssal layers, enacted the will of their respective demon lords and nalfeshnees, and tyrannically controlled lesser demons like dretches[4] and chasmes.[14] Given that they were seen as somewhat expendable and normally weren't smart enough themselves to realize when they were being duped into sacrificing themselves, hezrous often sought to make themselves useful to their masters so as to ensure they were not sent into unwinnable front-line situations. They were often spared from this duty of certain death.[1][2][4] Despite not being particularly good at scheming, hezrous still made use of temptation, making simple but cruel deals to those in states of despair. Every now and then in a century, hezrous went on what were called Dark Walks, plane-shifting to the mortal realm to make pacts with desperate souls. They would willingly enter their service and complete a major task like the destruction of a hated location or retrieval of a powerful artifact at the cost of trapping the mortal or a loved one in the Abyss and having them serve as a mane for eternity.[4] Otherwise, when on the Material Plane they recruited dull-witted followers in trolls, hill giants, ogres, and other creatures known for their power.[12] It was possible for a marilith to be demoted to a hezrou as a punishment, bringing a change in sex from female to male.[15] The Faceless Lord Juiblex was served primarily by hezrous who paid him significant fealty in victims. In fact, his primary servant, Darkness Given Hunger, was actually a hezrou demon whose possession of the largest known black pudding had been made permanent through magic, fusing the two together.[16][17] Demogorgon also employed many hezrous as lieutenants, although his were twice the size of any others within the Abyss.[14] Hezrous had a kind of half-organic armor plating under their flesh, an ancient alteration made by the sibriexes.[18] The hezrou Zaxis was actually a fallen marilith named Bethsiva, whose child was the balor Baalbisan with a rank even higher than hers.[15] Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

Despite being the shortest of giants, they had larger and more muscular appendages than other giant breeds. They had a rugged, barbaric look,[4][5] and if not for the lack of two heads could be mistaken for the relatively uncivilized ettins at a glance.[20] The traits that other races often saw as attractive were known to be considered strange and worthy of scorn to hill giants. Straight teeth, neat hair, unblemished skin, clear speech, and a lack of drool when eating were abnormal, if not repulsive traits.[21] Their own sweat mixed with the reeking stench of the crude, rough animal hides they wore. Animal skins worn by hill giants were poorly stitched with hair and leather thongs, not stripped of fur, and rarely cleaned or repaired, since hill giants normally opted to simply add more skins on.[1][4][5][6] A hill giant stealing pickles. Hill giants were selfish and brutish bullies that often forced weaker creatures to do their bidding. They lived as uncivilized savages, surviving by foraging, hunting, and raiding for food when not coercing other, smaller beings into doing the work and feeding them.[1][3][4][5][18] Although prone to evil behaviors, a hill giant's acts of cruelty were normally more along the lines of angry reactions than deliberate decisions. They were short-tempered creatures[22] whose form of chaotic evil was known to be defined by violent mood swings and losses of patience.[23] They were likely to go on a violent rampage if they felt deceived, mocked, or otherwise humiliated, and in their tantrums would rage against the guilty and innocent alike until they calmed down, grew hungry, or were otherwise distracted.[1] Their memories were also normally too short to hold grudges,[22] with some reported to forget those they recently met after waking up (which conversely could mean that any previously built rapport could be forgotten).[23] However, while most hill giants (around 40-50%) conformed to the chaotic evil behavior commonly found among them, true neutral and even chaotic good hill giants were not totally unheard of.[4][24][25] Hill giants equated size with strength, functioning based on a \"bigger is better\" mentality. Smaller creatures, sentient or not, were prey to hunt with impunity, while larger creatures, like dragons and bigger giants, were dangerous adversaries.[1] Following this logic, a hill giant of average intelligence might think to consume food in attempt to grow immense (not understanding biological limitations) and therefore superior.[26][27] The idea that giants were stupid was perhaps the most commonly stated misconception surrounding them, but few kinds embodied the fallacious belief more than hill giants.[28] Hill giants were reckless,[4] sluggish,[2] and notoriously moronic,[29] such that they would died out long ago if their great size and formidable power did not compensate for their dull wits and lazy disposition. Ironically, their mental weakness was partially perpetuated by their brute strength. Having never faced adversity that required adaptation and improvement, hill giants had managed to survive for millennia[1] with their lacking ambition,[7] living unchanged as barbarians with simple minds and underdeveloped emotions.[1] The least intelligent hill giants were mentally closer to beasts than civilized beings, while the brightest were above average compared to most humanoids.[28] Hill giants were blunt and direct in conversation, and though reasoning with them was useless, they could be manipulated into taking certain actions by more clever creatures. They had little concept of deception, to the point where villagers standing on each other's shoulders could cover themselves in blankets and hold a large, circular object above themselves to fool a hill giant into fleeing from the opposing giant.[1] Hill giants were much like ogres in terms of mental prowess, being as intelligent, if not stupider, than the smaller giant-kin.[28] Both had a tendency to be overly literal due to not thinking about their directions, misinterpreting even the simplest instructions due to their lacking consideration.[30] However, though potentially less intelligent than ogres, hill giants shared with them an exceptional cunning,[28] even outmatching them in craftiness.[18] Though they themselves were easily susceptible to the schemes of others, both were capable of surprising feats of cleverness, albeit in pursuit of limited desires.[28] As one would expect, hill giants were incredibly strong and extremely resilient.[4] Hill giants on the offense. Despite lacking brainpower and being infamously clumsy, hill giants were capable combatants.[5][29] Some of the already physically formidable beings even trained to become barbarians.[4] When they went looking for food, hill giants did so alone or with an animal companion, such as a dire wolf, to avoid having to split their spoils with other tribe mates.[1] A hill giant's preferred combat strategy was to utilize the time-honored giant tactic of throwing rocks at their enemies.[31] They pelted their enemies with boulders from high, rocky outcroppings, allowing them to injure their foes while limiting the risk of personal injury.[4][5] Assuming they could not pull rocks from the bags most giants carried around,[31][4] they could simply pull rocks up from the ground.[1] Normally the boulders they used were around 3\u202ffeet (0.91\u202fmeters) in diameter and 325\u202fpounds (147\u202fkilograms) in weight.[32] Their reported maximum throwing ranges varied, with the longest claimed distance being 600\u202ffeet (180\u202fmeters). They could also catch similarly-sized rocks (and other proportionate missiles) with an approximate success rate of about three in ten.[5][6][32] Once an opponent got into melee range, hill giants stopped hurling stones and began fighting in close quarters.[3] They favored the use of oversized clubs,[4][5][6] and could uproot trees to use as weapons if needed.[1] Some hill giant hunters were known to use javelins, but they still carried throwing rocks with them.[18] Hill giants had various favorite melee tactics. They loved overrunning smaller enemies at the start of a battle, trampling them underfoot before standing fast and swinging with their clubs.[4] When faced with more than one target, they made sweeping motions in an attempt to knock their enemies to the ground.[3] Some liked to hurl their whole, considerable mass at smaller foes, crushing their opposition beneath their formidable bulk.[33] Even hill giants, as dim-witted as they were, recognized that smaller foes would attack their lower body parts. As such, when they knew they were going to face human-sized enemies, they took certain precautions. They were known to peel thick strips of bark from trees and strap them to their legs as make-shift greaves, and to tie logs and stones to their belts so that foes trying to move under them would have to beware the dangling obstacles.[8] Hill giants were also wise enough to know that a hopeless situation was one to escape from, rather than continue fighting to the death.[3] When faced with the prospect of death, they might even fall into incoherent blubbering and sobbing.[34] Like other breeds, hill giants had developed their own value system over the millennia, and their unique culture was centered around one thing \u2014 food. According to the hill giant belief system, the one true meaning of life was to satisfy one's appetites, and over the years the dull creatures had managed to take this simple philosophy of hedonism to surprisingly deep extremes. Unusually learned hill giants were known to write elaborate poems using food and consumption in complex metaphors regarding the many trials of life.[29] Given the hill giant tendency to put all sorts of repulsive and rotting things in their mouths with little hesitation, some theorized that the species had no sense of taste or were so hungry at all times that taste was irrelevant.[7] In truth, hill giants had, over the course of their long history, consumed almost anything one could imagine (including various sentient beings) and enjoyed almost everything they tried. The kind of food that humans and elves would find appealing were appallingly dull to hill giants, who preferred more exotic dishes,[29] and since most recovered from getting sick, they rarely learned to avoid anything.[7] Despite their general ignorance and ineptitude, hill giants had unnatural gifts for both hunting and cooking,[29] and had actually developed some of the most sophisticated food preservation methods in all the Realms. Long had they known the benefits of smoking, salting, and freezing different foodstuffs, although despite these advancements about a fourth of their inventory was accidentally ruined or spoiled before it could be used.[36] They also had knowledge of certain properties of different foods, namely which were more fattening.[2] A hill giant's position in the Ordning (the social ranking system among giant breeds and giants as a whole) was based around an odd combination of physical might and gastral superiority.[37] Though the latter skill might seem like a strange factor to use for determining the chain of command, among hill giants, it was a trait synonymous with virtue. Because hill giants believed the purpose of life was self-gratification, it only made sense that the development of skills that helped them to accomplish that goal were the most worthy of being pursued, and thus that the giant who had best mastered such skills was obviously the most fit to lead.[38] Size was the same thing as strength to hill giants, and consuming food was not only satisfying, but made them even bigger. As such, the tallest, widest, and heaviest member of a hill giant tribe (normally but not always still able to move) was considered the most successful and admirable.[1][7][19] On the other hand, the lazy creatures also realized that overexerting themselves often made them thinner;[2] as one might expect, girth was perhaps the one area where hill giants excelled compared to other giant breeds.[7] The qualities that other beings expected or required of their leaders \u2014 including intelligence, decisiveness, and charisma \u2014 were not rewarded or recognized as important beyond their capacity to aid a giant in obtaining more food.[7] Some hill giants did not even consciously realize they followed an Ordning, simply operating on the belief that the larger and stronger giant was to be obeyed.[1] Only on rare occasions were relatively smart hill giants able to subvert their social order through cunning, such as by deceiving or intimidating others into giving them food or by gaining the favor of their superiors.[1][7] For hill giants, Ordning challenges to rise in rank took the form of epic eating competitions where two opposing parties would devour huge piles of food. After the massive meals were prepared, (hill giants involved would try to obtain lots of their favorite foods for such battles) the contestants would emerge, consume, and return every three hours until one side couldn't continue. In \"duels\" between the most gluttonous (and likely among the highest ranking) hill giants, these competitions could go on for weeks, with neither side allowed sleep. Unbelievable portions were consumed by the end of such matches, which ended with both participants often feeling utterly sick and nearly immobile.[29] At the top of a hill giant Ordning was the chief known as the storkokk, meaning \"master eater\" in their own giantish dialect. Because of the nature of the selection process they had to endure simply to obtain their positions in the first place, storkokks were almost always the most massive and rapacious hill giant in their steading. They also had among the greatest responsibility, for not only were they tasked with handling matters of state (which given hill giant attitudes would often sounded like discussions at an eatery), they were looked to by their kin for political leadership, spiritual guidance, and gastronomical inspiration.[39] Below the master eater were the gluttons, the highest ranking of hill giants. They were tasked with supervising labor, law enforcement, and the creation of new rules, but their most important duties were, supervising the obtainment of foodstuffs, hunting, and the creation of new recipes. A glutton that failed in these duties (such as if their food stores gradually dwindled down to nothing) was severely dishonored, and the pressure to succeed was so dire for some that they resorted to dishonest methods (including stealing from other gluttons) to keep up appearances.[39] The best and brightest hill giants were assigned the role of fetcher, a position meant to groom them for later greatness. Each was the assistant to a specific glutton and most master gluttons called upon their most trusted fetchers to handle minor details related to their positions, such as stocking the vegetables or non-exotic livestock. Hoarders meanwhile were those hill giants responsible for performing inventory, storing the perishables and cooking supplies, and reporting food levels to the relevant higher ups.[39] A hill giant herdgorger's shepherd crook was useful for picking bits of wool out of their teeth. Hill giant hunters stalked game and brought it back home (dead or alive), and were known to form hunting parties to do so. Certain limits, such as not hunting humans, were sometimes placed upon them depending on a tribe's diplomatic position. Conversely there were also gatherers, who obtained foods that could not be hunted or, ironically, gathered, by buying from merchants. Since hill giants had no use for treasure, they would often gladly pay above standard price for their purchases. Lowest in the Ordning were herders, who killed and butchered the tribal herd (or managed the slaves that did so) and were usually trained in various livestock fattening techniques (livestock sometimes including sentient humanoids).[39] As with most giant breeds, hill giants were loosely organized into huslyder, a giantish word roughly meaning \"families\", that were responsible for taking care of children. For hill giants, huslyder were large and communal,[40] and could be relatively unregimented compared to other giant societies, even if each giant still had specific assigned roles.[39] Normally a hill giant lair housed an extended family, sometimes including lone hill giants who were accepted into the family, which totaled around 9-16 hill giants. Of these, around half were male, a quarter female, and the remainder juveniles. Raiding and hunting parties of around 6-9 members were known to form, as were bands of similar numbers with the addition of 2-3 non-combatant members.[4][5] On occasions where a hill giant of average human intelligence emerged, there was the capacity of hill giants to be rallied by the superior intellect, creating groups of hill giants anywhere from 2-4 times the ordinary number. Such self-titled \"giant kings\" often raided human towns, and might even go so far as to attack other bands of giants.[5] A hill giant tribe normally had about 21-30 members in addition to about 7-11 non-combatants.[4] Among hill giants, the most maug (the equivalent of evil for giants) act a giant could commit was the betrayal of one's tribe. If a member of a tribe aided outsiders against that tribe, even for a morally good reason, all his peers, even those of good alignment themselves, would brand him as maug, and therefore worthy of shunning or punishment. On the other hand, even despicable hill giants could be convinced to stop a rampaging hill giant if he once betrayed his breed.[41] On occasion, hill giants were known to amuse themselves with inane games, normally involving food or eating in some way. One such game, known as \"stuff-stuff\" had the hill giants see how many small creatures (such as halflings, gnomes, or goblins) that they could fit into their mouths and once without swallowing.[7] Hill giants were also known to take amusement from wading in pools of water (which doubled as drinking water sources), even in regions with extremely low temperatures, and sometimes created such pools by damning rivers.[42] The idea of wives and husbands was present among hill giants, although polyamory was noted to occur. Even if both subjects would miss each other if separated, daily spousal abuse was not unheard of.[27][43] If a hill giant glutton discovered that his food stores were particularly well-stocked, they might decide to call a grand feast. A grand feast was a huge celebration infamous for total revelry and lack or restraint, and often ended with most of the tribe heavily drunk and fast asleep. During such feasts, an important guest from outside the tribe was often asked to part. This might be another giant chieftain or a diplomatic partner of another race, but since so few guests (including some higher-ranking giant breeds) could match a hill giant's sheer overindulgent gluttony, most would politely excuse themselves long before the end of the feast.[39] In lieu of engaging in their own lacking and myopic culture, hill giants were known to ape the traditions of other creatures instead, copying their methods without proper consideration. For example, a tribe might copy elves only to topple forests trying to live in trees, while those that tried to take humanoid villages as their own often only got as far as the door before accidentally demolishing the walls and roof.[1] One such imitation took the form of a hill giant declaring itself king and demanding tribute of livestock and produce from nearby humanoids,[18] a tyrannical reign of terror defined by the giant's shifting mood, with the constant threat of it forgetting its own title and eating its subjects on a whim.[1] Like other giant races, hill giants kept their belongings on them by keeping them in huge, hide sacks.[5] The primary purpose of the bag, especially for hill giants, was to carry food, for being as large as they were, it would be unwise to travel without rations.[31] Usually it also contained a giant's personal wealth, as well as somewhere between 2-8 throwing rocks and 1-8 mundane items. Hill giant possessions were usually well-worn, filthy, reeking, crude, and often jury-rigged or salvaged from something else. Examples included a wooden bowl and spoon, a drinking cup made from a gourd or skull, or a hand chopper made from the broken-off head of a battleaxe.[4][5] The crudely-sewn animal hides that hill giants wore functioned as leather armor. Nearly all hill giants wore such hides because they were a status symbol in some communities, indicating a larger number of kills depending on the amount of hides. Those from colder climates had developed greater skin preparation techniques, as it was needed to keep warm and prevent the chilling winds from getting in their lairs. Only a rare 5% of hill giants created metal armor, using the pieces of armor from defeated foes to fashion their own.[5] Hill giants lived in caves and excavated dens, but also constructed crude buildings to live in.[5] These could be thick tents made out of livestock hides,[42] clusters of well-defended mud wattle huts, and/or log forts and rough timer steadings.[1][18] Potential advancements could include stone walls and holes from which boiling oil could be poured out from.[42] In any case, hill giant lairs were often stinking and messy, strewn with decaying carrion and broken bones and saturated with blood and the residents' filth.[7] Hill giants often lived in fear of their larger giant cousins.[44] Although they did not consider it maug behavior (since for hill giants it was an inherent part of their ways) storm giants still considered the raiding practices of their lesser kin distasteful.[45] Hill giants served cloud giants, and might fight as brutes, act as fodder, battle for their amusement, or sometimes steal from humanoid lands (or \"collect fair tax\" as the cloud giants saw it) on their behalf.[46] Frost giants often enjoyed opportunities to mingle with other tribes so that they could show off their bravery and prowess, and particularly enjoyed their infrequent visits to hill giants since drink was so plentiful.[47] Although ettins also worshiped the same god as hill giants, albeit a two-headed aspect of him, that did not necessarily mean that the two species had friendly relations or any special affinity for each other. They merely paid him homage as a powerful ettin, and so were not granted spells (though they could still cast spells on their faith alone) while the hill giants truly worshiped him as a deity.[48][49][50] Ettins (alongside fomorians, who were known to be enslaved for the purpose) were sometimes used as the caretakers of a tribal herd.[39][51] Ogres were known to work for hill giants when impressed by their size or adamant ambition;[52] around half of hill giant lairs had guards, and a fifth of the time those guards consisted of 2-8 ogres.[4][5][6] Verbeeg sometimes maintained symbiotic relationships with both hill giants and ogres, and the three giant types sometimes shared so many similarities that the more ignorant members of smaller races could get them all mixed up.[30][22] The verbeeg provided greater intelligence and direction while the other types protected them. Watching them attempt to coordinate could be humorous to watch (if not their intended victim) as the infuriated verbeeg struggled to communicate with their stronger kin, who were routinely befuddled by their most basic commands.[30] A hill giant stealing from a village. Individuals and bands of hill giants had a tendency to be aggressively direct in their interactions, taking rather than trading. However, hill giant tribes (and some bands), often traded with other giants, including bands of ogres and other hill giants, to obtain foodstuffs, trinkets, and servants.[4][30] Many non-giant races could end up serving hill giants. Survivors of a defeated orc tribe, given their culturally ingrained bowing before superior strength, could come under the sway of a creature like a hill giant even despite its dim wits.[53] Both hill giants and frost giants sometimes kidnapped and enslaved goliaths to force them to do menial labor, and particularly evil ones captured them specifically for the purpose of eating or sacrificing them.[54] Many hill giant tribes had discovered that dwarves were more valuable as workers than as meals, and sought to capture them for the former purpose.[55] Galeb duhrs, creatures of living stone said by some to have once been dwarves, often served hill giants.[56] Despite their barbaric ways, hill giants still maintained a basically humanoid shape that made it easy for them to relate with more commonly civilized beings. They were never truly accepted into most civilizations, but could do well on the edges of society, forging strong and profitable lives on its frontiers.[4] They were known to serve in the military of other nations, such as in the armies of Thay.[57] Hill giants were also known to associate with fiends. Hezrous on the Material Plane, often used their above-average intelligence and great size to recruit less intelligent giants, hill giants included.[58] Hill giants were also known to work for some of the rakshasa nobles of Tirumala[59] Despite their voracity, hill giants did engage in the practice of keeping pets (even if the same kinds of creatures could also end up as food).[29] These were distinct from whatever monstrous scavengers, such as oozes, otyughs, ropers, and carrion crawlers, were attracted by the stench of a hill giant den. They performed a useful \"housekeeping\" service, but were not domesticated or tended to, simply tolerated. Ghouls also lurked around the fringes of hill giant settlements, but were less welcome since their greater craftiness, especially when led by a ghast, could allow them to not only drag away scraps, but steal whole meals.[60] Ignoring the 20% of the time the role was filled by ogres, hill giant lairs were protected by guard animals, either dire wolves (50% of the time) or giant lizards (30% of the time).[4][5][6] Otyughs, as well as being counted among scavengers, were known to follow certain hill giants around, acting like faithful dogs.[61] Hill giants normally lacked the intelligence required to learn wizardry,[62] and the majority were suspicious of magic to the point of ceremonially killing mages and destroying magic items they found.[5] However, hill giants had a few among them capable of runic magic, even if their low intelligence would normally prevent them from doing so.[31][63] Hill giant rune cutters, known in the giant tongue asskiltgravr, stomped huge symbols into hillsides and scarred their own flesh with magical markings.[31] Hill giants were known to speak the standard giant language of Jotun, but like most giant breeds, they had their own specialized dialect of the tongue, in their case Jotunhaug (which was closely interrelated to the frost giant dialect of Jotunise).[13] Although capable of speaking it, hill giants were among the giant types that were particularly prone to illiteracy due to the low value their culture placed on education and knowledge.[45] Seldom did they have the intelligence to learn to read,[22] instead telling their stories through pictograms etched into earth.[45] About half spoke the language of ogres,[5] but most spoke a little bit of Ogre and Gnoll,[13] and the smarter ones could learn languages such as Common, Draconic, Elven, Goblin and Orc.[4] Common given names among hill giants included the following:[64] As with all giant breeds, hill giants worshiped Annam as the greatest of the giant gods and the ultimate paragon of their kind's chosen ideal. In the case of hill giants, they imagined Annam to be an enormous, master glutton, and the keeper of the grandest pantry in all reality.[38][65] Hill giant priests had recast many ancient myths and legends regarding Annam and his associates as titanic struggles based around hunting, killing, cooking, and eating.[29] In a similar vein to Annam, hill giants perceived his eldest son, Stronmaus, to be a mighty fisherman, one more youthful, energetic, and carefree than the All-Father.[66] However, the racial patron of the hill giants was Grolantor, the least of Annam's sons[60] (with the possible exception of his younger brother Karontor).[17][67] For a long time, Grolantor (and his brother, the cloud giant deity Memnor) were forbidden from interfering with the affairs of the Jotunbrud by Annam, since when they were children, their mischievous \"play\" had thrusted the giants into a minor war with ogres. However, both Grolantor and Memnor managed to successfully argue that Annam's self-imposed exile had rendered his decree null and void. Once free to roam Toril, Grolantor started sending avatars amongst the Jotunbrud in the hopes of persuading giants to join him on his trouble-making outings, and naturally he received some of his warmest responses from the hill giants, who admired his courage and combat skill.[68][69] Even a hill giant who worshiped Grolantor, however was not necessarily evil or egotistical.[70] Grolantor frequently sent avatars to his worshipers to goad them into searching for glorious battle, often leading hunting bands of hill giants himself.[68][71] Unfortunately for them, Grolantor did not extend much loyalty back to them;[68][72] he was an uncaring god who only rarely checked on their wellbeing.[73] When confronted with powerful foes, his avatars were craven until challenged, at which point they fought to the death, and this willful stupidity got both him and his followers in over their heads. He was also known to withdraw from battles at their climax out of disinterest, deserting his followers (though true devotees viewed this as a glorious chance to prove themselves) in their greatest time of need.[68][72][71][74] Though he demanded none, most hill giant priests liked to sacrifice enemies and small valuables to Grolantor anyway.[48] The creed of Grolantor stated that the hill giants, as members of the Jotunbrud, stood above all others in the grand Ordning and were destined to rule Faerun,[72] and it was the duty of the faithful to persecute the lesser races (meaning all smaller than hill giants).[75] Furthermore, priests of Grolantor had to try and wipe out all weaker races (mostly those such as orcs, goblinoids, kobolds and similar beings) that stood in their way. They regularly organized warbands and hunting parties themselves, and[71] where they held political influence, they constantly urged their chieftains to launch invasions. Their favorite targets were goblins, dwarves, and dragons, and these raids were sometimes made against impossibly low odds.[72] Hill giant priests could also never admit weakness or inferiority. Despite their persecution of smaller beings, hill giant shamans refused to admit that other giants were actually bigger than them, never acknowledging their superiority and instead treating them as equals.[68][72][71][75] This behavior was instilled by Grolantor, who himself refused to admit that any being was his superior, claiming that their ancient kingdom could never be reborn without such pride.[68][72] The only thing close to a formal ritual in the undisciplined and disorganized clergy of Grolantor was the believed duty of hill giant clerics to regularly prove that they could out-eat anyone in the tribe. Backing down from a fight or challenge resulted in the loss of all powers until they atoned, normally involving diving headfirst into something even more daunting.[72] Hill giant priests existed both inside and outside the normal social structure. Often the priests of Grolantor, as they were sworn to do by the faith, took it upon themselves to find and destroy what they perceived as weakness in their society.[72] The primary responsibility of hill giant priests, however, was ensuring that their kin kept to the faith of the giant pantheon,[39] keeping them away from such blasphemously maug acts as worshiping entities like Yeenoghu.[45] Although there were no known cases of hill giants worshiping Yeenoghu, Vaprak the Rapacious (the ogre and troll god) had a few hill giant followers.[76] Priests of Grolantor had access to the unique spell known as Berserk Fury, where the casting priest entered a rage and would shout strange combinations of encouragements and insults. The ranting might infect other hill giants with a similar rage (although the number affected was limited by the priest's own power) and made them stronger or tougher. However, while under the spell's affects, none would be able to retreat, would stay in melee as long as possible, and would start attacking their allies if no more enemies were around until they could recover from the rage.[72] Hill giant shamans often had the power to manipulate the earth, using it to keep the enemy restrained, knock them from the air to the ground, and knock them prone with earthen waves.[18] Grolantor sometimes rewarded diligent shamans with a magical club that was particularly effective against dwarves. Only 5% of hill giant shamans owned such a club, and it only worked in the hands of one.[48] A mouth of Grolantor devouring pumpkins. In spite of their extraordinary constitution, hill giants could become sick when their voracious eating habits led them to consume something spoiled or rotten. Their lack of experience with such things made it all the more confusing when someone in their tribes did get ill, vomiting up whatever they had carelessly consumed. When a peer could not keep down their food, hill giants believed that the sickened tribe member was being used by Grolantor as a vessel to spread his message to the world.[2] After separating the sick individual from the rest of the tribe, often restraining them by tying them to a post or locking them in a cage, a hill giant priest or village chief would repeatedly visit them and attempt to read omens in whatever bile they retched up.[2] In actuality, there was no divine meaning behind the vomit whatsoever, as Grolantor did not communicate to his followers through signs.[71] This would continue until the giant either recovered, after which they would be set free and likely learn nothing, or until they went mad from starvation.[2] This was no accident, as the giant was intentionally being starved in an effort to turn them into a mouth of Grolantor, a perceived manifestation of their god's endless, aching hunger.[2] Simultaneously disgraced and holy, a mouth of Grolantor was stripped of their identity and personhood to be made into a living, sacred object. They were normally kept imprisoned, and one that broke out would almost certainly kill a few hill giants before being contained again or escaping to go on an even greater rampage. Hill giants were also known to release the on raids or use them as last resort defense when under attack.[7][2] Hill giants lived in the hills and mountain valleys across the world.[1] Though they preferred temperate regions, some lived in colder climates, and they could be found in any location where inclines in the land were abundant.[4][5] They lumbered up and down the slopes and blundered through the hills and forests where they lived, often in search of food.[1] Badlands, canyons, deserts, rocky barrens, mountain passes, caves, and similar underground environments could also house hill giants, and their lairs were often made in forsaken areas.[3][4][6] As with all giant breeds assigned a terrain to rule by Annam, hill giants had developed a natural mastery of their environment so absolute that it could be mistaken for (and sometimes was) magic. In their case, hill giants were invariably aware of the various secret passes and hidden crossways that dotted the areas surrounding their steadings.[16] Most of Toril's giants had gathered in the regions just south of the Endless Ice Sea and west of the desert of Anauroch.[77] They were known to prowl the foothills of the Spine of the World[78] and could be found in the Ice Spires mountain range.[29] In interior Faer\u00fbn, hill giants could be found in the Cloven Mountains.[79] On average, hill giants required more than ten times as much food as humans to survive, an even greater amount than both the larger stone and fire giants required. The reason for this disproportionate level of consumption in comparison to their size was that, over the years, hill giants had developed an excessively high metabolism.[80] Hill giants would eat almost anything, and with little else to occupy their time they ate as much as possible. Although smart enough to avoid eating anything obviously deadly (such as poisonous creatures) they were willing to consume such disgusting things as rotten meat, decaying plants, and even mud.[1] They gleefully gorged themselves on spoiled and diseased foods as if eating dessert, oblivious to the danger, and it was only their vulture-like constitution that fended off illness.[2] They were hated and feared by farmers for their ceaseless voracity, devouring live cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, chickens, fruits, vegetables grain, and perhaps the farmers somewhere along the line.[1][80] Hill giants mainly consumed meat,[5] which could include that of bears, griffons, ogres, humans, and demihumans among other kinds,[39] and was normally obtained through hunting.[5] Young green dragon flesh was considered a delicacy, and hill giants whose homes were covered by forests sometimes organized hunting parties to search for their lairs. In response, green dragons sometimes hunted and enslaved hill giants, who they considered to be their greatest enemy.[5][81] Hill giants possessed low-light vision,[4] and, like stone and cloud giants, could detect and identify living creatures within 30\u202ffeet (9.1\u202fmeters) by scent alone.[40] Most giants bore young in the same fashion as humans, with gestation periods for hill giants specifically being nine months.[40] Hill giant infants were completely incapable, but about as tough as a normal gnoll, while older children were about as capable as ogres.[5] Peaceful deaths were rare among hill giants (and frost giants), but they could live to be 200 years old.[8] A giant troll. Hill giants were known to be susceptible to all forms of lycanthropy, though were somehow immune to being afflicted with the wereraven form of the condition. Those afflicted with lycanthropy were most commonly found to be either werewolves, wereboars, wererats, or werebats. Compared to other giants afflicted with lycanthropy, hill giants were notably broad and suffered from awkward movement.[84] The lineage that would beget the hill giant race was started by the one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea, Ruk. Annam's children worked together to create Ostoria, and the kingdom's rolling hills would become the dominion of Ruk's dynasty.[15][85] The ancestors of the hill giants were enforcers who sprawled across all other lands of the time, subjugating the weaker creatures through their brute strength,[85] but the hill giant progenitors served as more than muscle. Like the higher giants, some among them created grand wonders, in their case a great stone circle that casted shadows which took the forms of hunters and animals, and which served as both a calendar and oracle.[22] Although hill giants were reviled as among the lowliest of giantkind, this, perhaps, was not always so, for hidden in many myths were suggestions that they were once much greater beings. This issue of origins was partially exasperated by the fact that the giant creator god Annam had various purported roles in the shaping of both giants and the multiverse. In some he created the entire multiverse and in others he worked with other deities to make all within it. Certain giantish myths regarding pre-history told of a time when giants were the first and only sentient lifeforms, and it was typical for their mythos to feature the existence of races of proto-giants.[17][76] An earth titan with two hill giants by its side. Hill giants were believed to be a weaker branch of the earth giant family, all of which nonetheless shared a connection to the primordial elements of earth and rock. The mightiest of these were the earth titans, brutes seemingly made from stone and soil.[18] Some time before -339 DR a descendant species of the hill giants known as the mountain giants broke off in the aftermath of a civil war. Although said to be smaller than hill giants, mountain giants were stronger, smarter, relatively kinder, had greater inherent magical power, and were ranked higher in the Ordning.[80][37][86][87][note 2] Some blame for the current degenerate state of the hill giants, however, was said to fall on the shoulders of Grolantor.[17] The hill giant race was often believed to have been the result of Grolantor's collection and interbreeding of the runts of many of the earlier giantish broods.[17] It was possible that modern ettins and modern hill giants came from the same stock, as both were noted to have a common social, cultural, and religious background.[50] In some myths, Grolantor himself further polluted this foul brood by mating with various earth-bound monstrosities (including serpentine creatures and medusa-like hags), and the vile hag goddess Cegilune.[17] Cheif Guh of Grudd Haug True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

        "description": "   The origins of these beasts has been lost to time.[7] Hippogriffs had the body of a horse, with the wings and head of a hawk or eagle. Their forelegs ended in sharp talons similar to those found in birds of prey, while their hind legs had hooves.[7] The average hippogriff was 9 feet long, with a wingspan of 20\u202ffeet (6.1\u202fmeters), and weighed about 1,000\u202flb (450\u202fkg)[8] Their hides would be colored russet, golden tan, or come in a variety of browns with differently shaded feathers. Their beaks were either ivory or golden yellow.[9] Hippogriffs were capable of expressing more complex emotions as well as feeling grief and crying.[10] Hippogriffs were extremely territorial and would attack any intruders in their realm, defending their mate or young until death.[7] They attacked by diving and attacking with their claws and beak. Though regarded as clumsy attackers, flocks of hippogriffs could attack in concert.[8] They could kill large prey such as bison, and were even capable of carrying it away in their talons. Being omnivores, they did not always have to resort to such tactics.[9] Hippogriffs were reclusive in behavior, seldom traveling far from their nest.[7] They had an omnivorous diet,[7] and would hunt humanoids as often as any other meal.[8] Hippogriffs were frequently preyed upon by both dragons and wyverns.[7] While some seemed to be of the opinion that female hippogriffs gave live birth,[7] the majority of accounts of their ecology gave mention specifically about their eggs.[8][9] Typically, hippogriffs bred in the spring and spent the summer months raising the youths. Domesticated winged mares sometimes were allowed to breed in the fall while raising their youths through the winter. By summer, the young hippogriffs were ready to be trained and ridden into combat. The off-season breeding was done with the use of boilers that heated the hippogriff aeries well through the cold seasons. When female hippogriffs prepared to lay eggs, they meticulously expanded their nests of hay, twigs, feather-layered bottoms. When preparing to care for their young, females cooed ancient hippogriff songs. They defended the nests as fiercely as they would the young.[10] A typical herd included one to three males, an equal number of mares and foals.[9] A hippogriff flying about. They live in temperate to tropical hills, in areas where it is particularly flat and barren, allowing them quick and easy access to the skies. A significant population existed in the Starspire Mountains in County Starspur in Tethyr.[11] In the Unapproachable East, they could be found around the Umbergoth mountain of Aglarond.[12] Hippogriffs were highly prized as aerial steeds. Because they were not as intelligent as griffons, a friendly attitude from the hippogriff to the rider or tamer was not required, but they still require a specialized saddle and appropriate training. The easiest way to tame a hippogriff was to steal an egg and raise it from birth, but these were not easy to obtain,[8] due to the ferocity of their defenders.[13] In Zakhara, the Caliphate of Huzuz raised large numbers of hippogriffs for military service.[14] A hippogriff egg could fetch 1,000 gp, 2000 gp by some accounts,[8] while young hippogriffs would sell for two to three times that price.[9] After the elven citadel of the Hand of the Seldarine was built circa 900 DR, the residents utilized hippogryphs as aerial support in battles defending the Seldarine. The history and practices of the magical beast breeding were described in the Hippogriff Riders of the Hand tome. The rider and their hippogryph trained tirelessly in working as a team. The hippogryphs were raised and trained from the moment they were hatched. They were trained on what to eat, how to perform complex battle maneuvers and respond to commands. The riders were taught o care for and groom their charges and how to handle them in battle. By 1281 DR, the citadel was long ruined and inhabited by the restless undead, souls of the inhabitants who fell in turmoil centuries earlier.[15] By 1217 DR, hippogriff cavalry was a staple of the Blade Kingdoms campaigns and skirmishes. Hippogriff troops participated in the Valley of Umbricci dispute between Colletro and Sumbria of 1217 DR.[16]",

By and large, hobgoblins, like their kin, were considered to be evil creatures and often met this expectation. While goblinoid society was typically cruel and harsh, some individuals escaped it to carry on lives of virtue. The few who took this risk and succeeded often met cautious praise and acceptance from outsiders. Those that managed to escape goblinoid society, however, were continuously plagued by their goblinoid nature. Though hobgoblins were not necessarily evil, they were prone to violence and hot tempers, and often found it difficult to be truly altruistic.[3] When provoked, which was not a hard task, hobgoblins were vindictive creatures who took glee in causing pain to those that injured them. Those hobgoblins who overcome this nature often managed this because of the rewards they found in serving good, rather than evil.[3] A group of hobgoblin bandits near the Cloakwood. Hobgoblins were mostly found in communities where they were in command of either goblins or bugbears, or sometimes both. The most civilized goblinoid communities were ruled by the race. This was in large part because hobgoblin society was more industrious and less savage than that of goblins or bugbears.[10] Though bugbears sometimes took control due to their raw strength, most such communities were ruled over by the strongest hobgoblin, who served as the warchief.[13] Hobgoblins had a long tradition of mastering and breeding the creatures of the world into slaves of various sorts. Many, for instance, enjoyed working with wolves or worgs. Similarly, many drake breeds were first bred by hobgoblins. Some even believed hobgoblins carried this practice on within their own race, creating the goblins and bugbears in such a manner.[10] Hobgoblins were immensely protective of their tribe's reputation and military status, so much so that meetings between different groups could turn violent if proper protocol was not followed. However, though hobgoblin tribes were territorial and egotistical in nature, they often united for a common purpose, such as war against non-goblinoids.[13] Hobgoblins once had their own pantheon, however, Maglubiyet, the god of war and rulership, killed most of the gods. Since then, he was the chief deity of hobgoblins. However, Nomog-Geaya, the deity of war and authority, was considered their patron deity, and many followed Bargrivyek.[14] After the Spellplague but prior to the Second Sundering, Maglubiyet was an exarch of Bane.[15][note 1] Hobgoblins were warriors by nature and prefered martial combatants to those who draw on magic. Those few spellcasters who were to be found were expected to work well with soldiers.[13]",

It also knew everything its creator knew, including the ability to understand and read any languages known by its creator. Although they possessed a telepathic link to their masters, homunculi could not verbally speak.[1] If the creator of a homunculus died, the creature also perished[1][7] and its body melted away into a pool of ichor.[3] Homunculi were very poor combatants, only being able to utilize a bite with their little mouths. However, they had a small chance to poison their foes. If their foes reacted badly to the poison, they could become unconscious.[1] A close up of the hand and foot of a homunculus. The vast majority of homunculi were created by wizards and artificers.[8] Some artificers were also capable of constructing specialized homunculi designed to aid them and their allies in battle.[9] As constructed creatures, homunculi did not require food or water to survive. They also did not need to breathe or sleep.[8] Homunculi were created through a lengthy procedure involving sculpting the construct's body from clay, ash, mandrake root, and spring water. The entire procedure needed to be carried out in a properly equipped alchemist's laboratory. The base component cost for shaping the body was 50 gp, but stronger homunculi could be created by employing finer components at a larger cost.[3] The sculpture was then brought into life by mixing it with 1\u202fpint (470\u202fmilliliters) of its creator's blood.[1][3] The blood needed to be collected through the use of a ceremonial dagger encrusted with jewels worth no less than 1,000 gp. The sculpted body was then brought to life via a 1-hour-long incantation of the create homunculus spell. A spellcaster could only have one homunculus at a time.[7] A depiction of a tiny winged homunculus. This blood created a mystical bond, allowing the creator to see and hear everything the homunculus experienced over great distances, so long as they were on the same plane. However, there was a drawback in that if the construct was slain, the creator suffered damage.[3][1] It was also possible to transfer some of the homunculus's master's own vitality into the construct, in order to temporarily boost its vitality.[7]",

They were 600\u202flb (270\u202fkg), roughly humanoid beings with bodies sheathed in repulsive scales.[2] The presence they possessed was considered intimidating even to other devils, as their massive wings, sweeping horns, and serpentine tails furthered their frightening appearance.[1][2] Despite being among the most capable and cunning of the baatezu, cornugons were also some of the least likely to betray their superiors, making them powerful assets.[3] The true source of their loyalty was a point of contention although they notably hated and feared those stronger than themselves and so acted to avoid risk to themselves.[1] While some claimed their true nature was militaristic and disciplined others said their loyalty stemmed from laziness, and their love of battle from belligerence.[1][3] Regardless of the reasons for their obedience, if thoroughly agitated they were capable of daunting rage.[1] The wings of a horned devil were not for show, allowing them to move across the battlefield far quicker than moving on foot. In addition to their ability to fight with their fangs and claws, cornugons inflicted infernal wounds on those whose skin they pierced with their tails.[4] Such wounds persistently and profusely bled, slowly draining the victim of their blood and never naturally healing. Only capable medicine or skilled healing magic was capable of ending the bleeding.[2] Cornugons could choose to radiate an aura of fear around themselves within a 5\u202fft (1.5\u202fm) radius, to terrify non-baatezu. They could also regenerate any damage they suffered except from good-aligned or silver weapons or inherently good spells.[2] Cornugons possessed a wide variety of innately magical abilities, allowing them to hurl lightning, create incredibly dangerous flames and craft powerful illusions. They also had the ability to call upon a wide variety of devils, including a small mob of lemures, a group of barbazus, a flock of abishai or a few more cornugons.[2][3] Cornugons often fought with military forks or spiked chains, with which they would stun their enemies.[3] They were bold in combat and rarely retreated even when dangerously outmatched. They typically swooped into combat from the air attempting to quickly disable and eliminate the most powerful threats first with their forks, chains or tails.[1][2] Spellcasters among the cornugons were infrequent. Few were willing to put aside their physical training long enough to become noteworthy wizards and only rarely did they retain any of their former allegiances to deities once they reached their place in the infernal hierarchy.[8] From left to right, a barbazu, a cornugon, and an erinyes. Cornugons occupied the lower circles of Hell, particularly Malbolge and Maladomini, where they served as its elite flying infantry.[1][4] Their armies numbered up to 2,000 of their kind and only beings of pit fiend status were allowed to lead their infernal legions. Horned devils were also the elite bodyguards of Baator, desired by powerful gelugons and pit fiends alike to serve as personal guards and retainers.[3] Along with hamatula, cornugons were among the fastest advancing baatezu. Cornugons capable of showcasing their abilities through several military successes would be given command over vast armies of lesser devil soldiers. The only faster path to advancement from that point would be direct service to the Dark Eight, making it an incredibly desired position.[3] Cornugons that did prove themselves particularly exceptional were allowed to serve among the 106 cornugons already protecting the Dark Eight. Said cornugons possessed an extreme loyalty rarely seen within the traitorous depths of Baator, rumored to be willing to die for the council whether out of genuine devotion or simply out of sheer terror of the consequences for forsaking them.[3] Cornugons that managed to serve with the 106, advanced relatively quickly for baatezu, reaching gelugon status within a millennium or so.[7] In the infernal hierarchy of the baatezu, cornugons were thought to be the least of the greater devils but still awarded with prestige for their rank.[3][note 2] Corugons often had names that translated into such things as \"Bent Wing\" or \"Evil Tail\".[4] A depiction of a vicious cornugon. In order to make cornugons more effective against the tanar'ri in the Blood War, experiments were performed to create a new form of horned devil.

        "description": "   All shark species were utterly fierce, aggressive, and fearless. They were relentlessly hungry.[3][2][1] Sharks were tactical hunters, using their keen senses to circle their prey just outside of their field of view and charging to attack at the most opportune moment. Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth were effective against many different targets, sometimes even ship hulls.[3][2][1] These creatures had been swimming in the oceans for thousands of years with little change in their appearance or methods.[2] Sharks were categorized into medium, large, and huge species.[3] Large sharks included hunter sharks that preyed on deep waters, and fleshtearer sharks, which were found in various environments, including underground rivers and lakes.[1][2] They usually hunted alone, but could also be found in groups.[1] A species of muck-dwelling freshwater shark known as barbfish inhabited lower reaches of the Riven Specie in Amn.[6] The smaller types of sharks were very common in the waters surrounding Chult. The Bay of Chult and Refuge Bay contained large groups of reef sharks. Hunter sharks and reef sharks hunted off the coast of Ishau, as well as Jahaka Anchorage.[10] In the Shining Sea, they lurked in the sunken ruins of Untisczer.[11] Mako, goblin, and hammerhead sharks lived and hunted in the close vicinity of the Temple-Under-The-Sea, the submerged temple to Umberlee in the Fiddler's Green underwater region of the Sea of Swords.[5] Outside of the Prime Material plane, sharks were extremely prevalent in Draga Salt-Biter's domain of Saragoss in the Domains of Dread.[12] Sharks were revered by sahuagin and could be trained by them. Their kinship to sahuagin was so strong that even wild sharks considered them allies and did not attack them. Sahuagin could also telepathically issue commands to nearby sharks.[13] Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari had a wide variety of sharks as servants in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.[14] Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold shark hides for 15 gp a piece.[15]",

        "description": "      A hydra was not very intelligent, about as much so as an animal. Hydras were usually neutral in alignment.[3] A hydra was an especially deadly monster, since every time a head was severed, two new ones grew in its place.[3] Scholars from Candlekeep believed hydras evolved from proto-dragons.[6] In the late 1340s DR, the explorer Hadley Erridge of Thunderstone in Cormyr suggested to his neighbor, the enterprising and prosperous farmer Del Geery, that he get a hydra to scare off the pests plaguing his crops. Geery agreed to finance Erridge's expedition into the Vast Swamp to capture a live hydra. Two months later, they returned with an adult hydra in an iron cage. Erridge released the hydra and it rampaged about the farm, scaring away all the animals within a few days. However, despite what Erridge said about the hydra returning to the swamp when it ran out of prey, it instead stuck around and began building a nest by the pond. The hydra was, in fact, pregnant. Outraged, Geery gave Erridge the sack then hired a group of warriors to slay the hydra. Afterwards, he hired the best rangers and wizards in Cormyr to help him discover the uses to which he could put a hydra carcass, intending to use every part of the beast and recover his losses. He was so successful at this new trade that he began to fund new hydra-hunting expeditions in the Vast Swamp.[7] By 1367 DR, he'd earned a reputation and a fortune in the hydra trade.[7][8] A dwarf in battle with a hydra. A pregnant hydra preparing to give birth would build a nest for this purpose. It dug a pit beside a pond or body of water, then lined it with sticks and weeds.[7] A hydra from the wilderness near Neverwinter. Hydras were typically found in the marshes of regions with a temperate climate.[3] Many hydras were known to inhabit the Forest of Wyrms.[11] They also were quite common in the jungles of Chult.[12] Some individuals of most types of hydras were servants of the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and their appearance was considered a good omen by his followers.[13] The enterprising farmer and hydra-hunter Del Geery developed a number of useful agricultural products from the body parts of the hydra, as follows:[7]",

They were capable of tripping with their sharp jaws.[3] Gnolls, unsurprisingly, had a strong affinity for hyenas, keeping many as pets or guards.[6] The Mulhorandi god Set also favored hyenas, using them as omens for his followers.[7] In the Shining South hyenas were known to be found in and around the Channath Vale, Dambrath, Durpar, Estagund, the Gnollwatch Mountains, the Great Rift, and the Shaar.[8] North of this region, they could be found wandering the Raurin desert.[9]",

        "description": "      Gelugons were blue and white, insectile bipeds that stood about 10.5\u201212\u202fft (3.2\u20123.7\u202fm) tall and weighed around 700\u2009lbs (320\u2009kg).[3][5][7] Their hands and feet ended in claws and their long, thick tails were surrounded in spikes.[3] Their heads hosted a set of antenna, sharp mandibles, and a pair of multifaceted eyes.[4][8] Gelugons resented the weak and respected the powerful, regardless of their allegiances.[2] They begrudgingly cooperated with weaker devils, seeing them as either pawns or outlets for their frustration.[1][2] Their desire for the power held by the pit fiends ingrained not only diligent loyalty, but also a crippling fear of making mistakes. While ice devils still schemed to obtain souls for their masters, they avoided complex plans and attempted to delay the end of their plans until after they were promoted.[9] Gelugons were savage warriors that fought their enemies with their claws, pincers and tails.[3] The body of a gelugon, but particularly the tail, was surrounded by an aura of numbing cold that slowed those they struck.[2] They were also known to freely exude an aura of fear that caused most to run in terror, and slowly regenerated when not harmed by good-aligned spells or weapons.[3] A gelugon using icy magic An ice devil's magical abilities allowed them to fly, and manipulate the cold in various ways, but their ability to create walls of ice was particularly chilling, freezing those that approached them and dissipating into dangerously frigid air when destroyed.[1][3] They had a wide variety of devils they could attempt to gate in for assistance, including lemures, barbazus, osyluths, or another ice devil.[3] A gelugon and its legion devil soldiers are shocked. The wicked savagery of the gelugons was fully displayed when they were not leading soldiers into battle, as their hatred for weakness led them to destroy their frailest foes first.[2][3] Their typical combat strategy was to immobilize the frontline first, allowing them to use their speed and reach to strike at softer enemies thus preventing their victims from fleeing.[2] However, the ice devils were also goal-oriented, fighting only if needed to complete their mission but never backing away from necessary battles or easy victories.[3] Because of the important nature of their work, it was possible that losing ice devils would be fortunate enough to have a pit fiend come to their aid.[4] They favored unarmed combat, destroying their targets with their numerous natural weapons or by using their supernatural abilities to send enemy ranks into disarray.[2][5] Despite this preference for unarmed combat, one in four gelugons wielded barbed spears so chilling that most were paralyzed by their frost.[4] While gelugons are most commonly found within Cania, a great number populated the icy expanse of Stygia. A regiment of gelugon soldiers were stationed on ice floe rafts in order to defend the tomb of Levistus.[4][10] Gelugons were both leaders and soldiers, a unique position among the baatezu, and were almost exclusively responsible for commanding infernal troops.[3][4] Because ice devils had no qualms with sending weak soldiers to their doom, and preferred to battle alone, they made poor generals. Both powerful mortals and devils alike used them as personal guards and elite warriors.[2] Gelugons tirelessly pursued promotion, faithfully accomplishing their missions and collecting as many souls as possible for their masters.[1] The fortress of Malsheem laid within Nessus and had only one portal entrance located at the bottom of a deep pit with Cania. It fell solely to the ice devils to protect the portal, and at any given time the ninth circle of Baator was protected by 9,999 gelugon guards. The pit fiends were forced to put immense trust in the gelugons and occasionally defend them when they were losing, but the formidable requirements for gelugon promotion allowed the pit fiends to safely rely upon them.[4] Simply making it on to the list of candidates required a gelugon to serve for 777 consecutive years without making a single mistake, with most having to repeat the qualification process over nine times.[4][9] Gelugons, along with pit fiends, were the baatezu most adept at wizardry, though they took up the practice less often than their superiors. They advanced as normal wizards did, but learned more cold-related spells in addition to the typical amount, and also researched icy variants of existing spells (such as a freezing as opposed to a flaming sphere).[11] A gelugon that finally earned their promotion was subjected to the hellfire of the Pit of Flame, experiencing 1,001 days of excruciating agony before being reborn as a pit fiend.[4] A gelugon standing on an iceberg in Stygia. A gelugon standing in frigid Cania. Although other baatezu occasionally visited, gelugons were the only native devils of Cania and it was said that their frigid aura was taken from the realm itself.[4] Unlike most devils, gelugons found colder climates more hospitable, although their immunity to fire allowed them to dwell even in scorching hot regions. The humid bogs of Minauros and molten plains of Phlegethos were both physically and visually disquieting for ice devils.[12] Gelugons possessed the ability to see ultraviolet light.[5] Because electricity was a glaring vulnerability of the baatezu, experiments were performed in an attempt to create gelugons that were more resistant to shock. While some tests succeeded the resulting ice devil's had their ability to radiate cold reduced. Other tests produced the opposite result, causing gelugons that were even more frigid than normal. Such gelugons were often deployed alongside yugoloth mercenaries, exploiting the daemon susceptibility to cold in order to ward off their typical treachery. Shock-resistant gelugons could be recognized by their extra antenna and transparent skin while colder gelugons were a shade of blue so bright that it never faded, even within the color-draining Gray Wastes.[8] The enchanted spear called Gelugon's Gouge was crafted out of an ice devil's tail barb.[13] The eyes of these creatures were capable of seeing in both total darkness[1][3] and the ultraviolet spectrum.[5] In addition, gelugons were capable of viewing their surroundings without their visual senses.[1][3] In the ancient past, the gelugons were a race of mercenary fiends similar to the mezzoloths. The archdevil Mephistopheles managed to trap their kind in a state of perpetual servitude millennia ago and turned them into denizens of the Nine Hells.[14] Gelugons had been driven to the fringes of their frozen domain due to Mephisto's obsession with developing a new form of magical hellfire. Despite their self-imposed exile, gelugons were still the most numerous residents of Cania, but had been supplanted as the favorite servants of their archdevil by beings like the pit fiends who were capable of aiding their lord's research. Although uncertain on whether to try and persuade or overthrow Mephistopheles, no ice devil openly criticized his decision, instead targeting their aggression at those who encouraged his behavior.[15]  Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

Imps were masters of flattery, coercing others into acts of lawful evil through wheedling service due to lacking the intimidating presence held by other devils.[2][9] When not outright trying to corrupt, they engaged in unscrupulous mischief, such as swiping valuables. Regardless of the fawning fa\u00e7ade they upheld, imps were ultimately at the service of their infernal lords and viewed their worldly masters as tools.[2][4] At the same time, their obedience to their leaders in Hell was rooted in craven pragmatism rather than genuine loyalty.[10] Even though they were always at the service of another, whether a devil or mortal, imps were still independent creatures with ambition that belied their small size and sycophantic demeanor.[4] Their true desire was like that of most devils, to advance beyond their current station and obtain a position of power, and offering them the chance to do so was the only way to obtain their true loyalty, if only temporarily. When provided with positions of power, their helpful personas faded away to reveal the authority abusing tyrants they kept hidden.[10] A particularly nefarious imp, spying upon others. While within their natural forms, imps fought with their venomous tails, piercing the skin and injecting a potentially fatal toxin into their assailants.[1][4] If needed, however, imps could polymorph into a variety of beast forms and individuals often had either one or two of them. Such forms were physically identical to normal animals and still allowed the imp to use their venom, although filtered through the animal's bite. Common animal forms for imps included that of a spider, rat, boar, raven or goat, although within raven and goat form they lacked the ability to use their venom.[3][4] Whether in their natural forms or in the form of animals, imps retained their various magical abilities. They could turn invisible and detect the presence of either magic or good at will. They also had the ability to use the suggestion spell once per day.[4] Imps were strangely durable creatures, healing from injuries with supernatural speed, and resisting fire, cold, poison, magic and electric-based abilities. Only silver or enchanted weapons were effective against an imp.[1][4] So long as an imp served as a familiar its master obtained certain benefits through the imp sharing its power. A telepathic link was established between the two so long as they were only a mile apart, allowing the caster to share senses with the imp, including its infravision, and empowering the master's spellcasting abilities. An imp closer to its master also granted them their regenerative abilities and resistance to magic.[4][5] On the other hand, an imp separated from their master became weaker than normal, and the death of the imp could cause them to take a severe loss in ability. When serving as familiars imps were also given the power to request wisdom from the archdevils, contacting them to ask six questions with a power similar to the commune spell.[5] The bond between an imp familiar and its master was established through a contract and violating the services of the deal caused an imp to retract its service and all benefits thereof.[1] Although durable, imps were cowardly creatures that did battle only if necessary.[2] When fighting, imps relied on the element of surprise, first turning invisible or entering animal form. From there, they waited for an opportunity to strike, such as the enemy becoming distracted, before striking and escaping from reach.[2][3] Imps would immediately flee if a battle was no longer going in their favor, but the exception to this rule was when their mortal charges were in danger. This apparent loyalty, however, was mere illusion, as an imp was only concerned with keeping their ticket to promotion and connection to the mortal realm.[1][3] Although they could be found throughout the Lower Planes, imps were most commonly found within Acheron and particularly Baator.[1][4] Occasionally they were found in groups, but they were more likely to be in the service of other malevolent beings.[2] They were willing to serve any kind of evil master but could not always be relied upon to be swift or efficient in their duties.[1] When under the rigid rule and watchful eyes of baatezu masters, however, imps followed commands as best as they were able, often serving as errand-runners, spies or emissaries.[4][10] Imps performed many roles in the hands of mortals, acting as advisors, scouts, assistants, confidants and, most importantly, familiars.[1][8] They typically served under lawful spellcasters like wizards and priests, or anyone else seeking magical power. Mortals judged worthy of an imp received them when they cast a find familiar spell, doing so based on the misconception that imps were weak and dutiful servants.[2][4] Lacking the authority to make Faustian bargains, imps relied on their ability to persuade and their available resources to quicken the corruption of their targets.[9] Imps fostered a lust for power within the hearts of their summoners by increasing their magical abilities, either through helping them acquire new spells or magical items. Using hindsight, spying and the knowledge bestowed on them from other devils, imps obtained a large sum of knowledge about arcane subject matters.[2] After making contact, imps would pretend to be at their summoner's service while secretly trying to control their actions.[4] Imps assigned to mortals as a part of deals were in an inferior position to those able to freely choose their targets, as beings willing to summon devils were normally already doomed to Baator and the devil who made the deal would be given the credit. When stuck in such a situation imps often attempted to corrupt as many souls as possible during their time as familiars. While some tried to extend their scheming service to those near their masters, others tried to sway influential individuals into changing their society in ways that caused others to commit diabolical deeds.[9] While physically weak compared to some lesser devils, the rank of imp was envied since the successful temptation of mortals to the acts of evil was one of the surest paths to further promotions. When a devil became an imp, it was often the first time they had the chance to be directly credited for damnation rather than marked as a lackey to another. For this reason, being given the ability to roam freely on the Material Plane to find vulnerable mortals was a highly desirable role, releasing an imp from the tight regulations of Hell and giving them complete credit for their works. Not all souls were equal within the Nine Hells, and the corruption of an important individual could be viewed as equal to that of a great number of souls. The average amount of souls required to qualify for promotion was somewhere around nine. Imps could also be promoted due to other notable deeds such as the rooting out of traitors.[9] Devils were normally discouraged from worshiping deities by the powers of the Nine Hells.[11] In addition to serving powerful devils or evil spellcasters, however, imps could be found in service to Deep Duerra, the duergar goddess.[12] Imps would eat any form of meat, whether alive or dead. Although they did not require sleep, imps occasionally rested in the Material Plane in their animal forms to take a break from their constant duties. Imps had to earn their right to a gender, toiling for centuries before being assigned one based on their works.[10] While other devils could be transformed into imps, they were also made from soul larvae twisted into form by powerful devils.[4][9] They did not age naturally and if slain on another plane of existence reformed on their native planes after a year and a day had passed. Imps perpetuated the idea that their kind were the descendants of a variety of modern fiends.[4] Imps were the lawful equivalents of the quasits, another diminutive race of fiends that coerced mortals into committing heinous acts for power.[4] There existed a variety of specialized imps that served specific functions within Hell, such as medical care or translating.[8] (From left to right) A blood bag imp, euphoric imp and filth imp Assassin imp \u2022 Bloodbag imp \u2022 Euphoric imp \u2022 Filth imp[8] Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

They could only be perceived as a shimmering mass of air on the Material, Astral and Ethereal planes, similar to the refraction that's caused by hot air passing in front of cold.[4] Invisible stalkers were known to deeply resent any task given to them, but were relentless in pursuing its completion. If the stated task took the stalker a week or more to complete, it would gradually pervert the stated intent of their assignment and look for loopholes. Because of this, commands had to be carefully worded.[4] Some held a deep distrust or outright hatred of humanoids, due to suffering at the hands of ones who summoned them or having been killed by humanoids.[4] Stalkers had the innate ability to remain invisible even in combat. Stalkers attacked by using gusts of wind to pummel their opponent. Killing an invisible stalker anywhere other than its home plane dismissed the stalker back to its home.[3] The life of invisible stalkers on their home elemental plane was largely unknown, with many assuming it was similar to that of the standard air elemental.[4] The presence of invisible stalkers on the material plane was typically due to being summoned by a mage or wizard to perform some task.[3][4]",

Though they typically were built to resemble some form of armor. The features of their comparatively smoother than that of a stone golem.[4] The average iron golem was about 12\u202fft (3.7\u202fm) tall and weighed 5,000\u202flb (2,300,000\u202fg).[1] Iron golems were always dutifully obedient to whoever constructed them. When left in a room with no activity going on they would move into a dormant state, standing still.[6] Like any golem, these constructs possessed an immunity to magic and could not be harmed by normal weaponry. Only weapons with an enchantment of +3 or greater and magical lightning was known to be capable of harming them. However, their bodies of were particularly vulnerable to rust monsters.[4][6] The strength of these constructs was three times that of any flesh golem.[6] Due to the use of the spell cloudkill in their construction, iron golems were known to be capable of breathing out clouds of poisonous gas.[3][4][6] Much like a stone golem, these constructs relied heavily on their brute strength when fighting. However, unlike them an iron golem was known to wield swords, occasionally even enchanted ones, that were part of its construction.[4] Like any construct, iron golems could be found anywhere across the Realms regardless of climate or terrain.[4] In older ages the combined cost of spell components and the 5,000\u202flb (2,300,000\u202fg) of iron needed to construct an iron golem was around 80,000 gp. An ornate sword was also required \u2014 if the sword was magical, there was half a chance that its magic would be drained as the golem was animated. The construction process took about three months and forging of their body needed to be done by a smith skilled in working iron.[4] Construction of these constructs could only be undertaken by magic-users of an 18th level or higher and required use of the spells cloudkill, geas, polymorph any object, and wish.[4][6] These spells could be cast by the user themselves or by means of an enchanted item, such as a scroll or wand.[4] Alternatively, the construction of an iron golem could be undertaken by any individual that owned a manual of golems[7] or the Tome of the Unicorn.[8] Iron golems were typically used to guard locations or valuable items.[4] Iron golems, called the dwarven statue golems, were used by inhabitants of the Dwarven Dungeons in Myth Drannor before its fall. In 1369 DR their magic was still strong and the constructs could be found still guarding the areas assigned to them hundreds of years prior.[9] Iron golems were not only used by mortals; the gnome god Flandal Steelskin also sent them to the Material Plane to do his bidding.[10]",

This ability did not work if the whale's hearing were to be impaired or if its detecting area was under the effect of a silence spell.[2][1] Orcas were vicious predators that attacked anything within their range of detection.[2] However, they were not excessively hostile, usually only attacking when hungry or provoked.[3] They were also intelligent animals that could be communicated with.[3] A killer whale fights off a group of blood frenzied sahuagin The main weapons killer whales used in combat were their powerful bites, which they could use to hold down their prey until it drowned.[2][1][3] Despite being aggressive hunters, killer whales had a caring family structure, fiercely defending their calves, and sometimes even other whales, against threats. They were also known to ally themselves with aquatic elves.[3] Killer whales were typically known to hunt fish and squids, as well as several kinds of warm-blooded animals, including seals, other whales,[2][3] porpoises, dolphins, walruses, and penguins.[5] They were resourceful hunters that employed sophisticated hunting strategies such as breaking ice sheets to knock their occupants into freezing cold water. A pod of killer whales was capable of collaborating to bring down much larger prey.[2][3] One of the bodies of water that they were most often encountered in was the Sea of Fallen Stars.[6] They were also known to be found in waters around the North.[7] Beyond Toril, orcas were commonly found in the temperate latitudes of the planet Karpri. Whales native to that planet were unusually calm and graceful, a trait which caused them to be heavily hunted by outsiders.[8]",

        "description": "   A kobold was a reptilian humanoid,[12] standing between 2' and 2'6\" (60cm \u2013 75cm) tall, weighing 35 to 45 pounds (16 \u2013 20kg), with scaled skin between reddish brown and black in color and burnt orange to red eyes. Their legs were sinewy and digitigrade. They had long, clawed fingers and a jaw like a crocodile.[12] Small white or tan horns protruded from their head,[13] and they had rat-like tails. They would often smell of wet dog and stagnant water. Kobolds liked to wear red or orange garments, which were usually ragged.[10] Kobolds were not above using the most sinister of tricks to blend in among human crowds. Kobolds were resentful of their short stature and hated members of other races who poked fun at them for this. Most felt as though they ought to compensate for their small size in other ways, such as humor or aggression.[14] They would naturally tend to hate larger creatures, and although they would show respect and obedience if required, they always looked for ways to display their resentment.[15] The ultimate goal of the kobold race was to conquer as much land as possible.[14] They would plan and dig mines industriously, while laying cruel traps for interlopers, preferring an ambush to direct confrontation. If they ever confronted an enemy, they would try to overwhelm foes with sheer numbers.[4] Among the monstrous humanoids, they were known for cunning plans, and unlike many others, would also share those plans among the entire tribe. General plans and goals would be common knowledge, and detailed plans were shared with all who asked to allow them to work fruitfully for the good of the tribe. Their society was influenced by their lawful evil alignment. Kobolds were confident and happy to remain separated from the other races. Where other races considered heroes to be those who enact great feats of strength or military prowess, kobold heroes were those who showed great prowess in trap setting, torture and ambush.[15] Kobolds were extremely fecund egg-layers, having the highest birth rate among humanoids.[citation needed] A pregnant female would lay her egg within two weeks. About one in ten pregnancies led to two eggs. An egg needed incubation for about two months, but the newly hatched kobold could walk in just hours. The eggs were particularly sturdy, and the young inside could survive even if the egg broke as much as fifteen days early.[16] Kobold young matured quickly, having reached young adulthood in six years.[12] They often laid eggs in a common nest, with specialized foster parents watching over the eggs and wyrmlings.[citation needed] Some rare kobold children had wings,[1][2] while still others were dragonwrought, and showed signs of descent from a specific color of draconic ancestor.[17] It was possible to identify a dragonwrought egg because the shell would be speckled with flecks of the dragon's color, which became more numerous throughout the incubation period.[16] While winged kobolds were often disparaged by ordinary kobolds,[1][2] ritual demanded that dragonwrought eggs be taken to a sacred hatching place so that dragonwrought kobolds could be raised above ground in case they were able to fly and needed to learn to use their wings.[18] Like other reptiles, kobolds shed their skin periodically. A growing kobold might do this as frequently as weekly, but a developed one usually shed once per season. Unlike snakes, kobolds did not shed their entire skin at once; they instead shed portions of it over a period of time, much like lizards do. The process was usually accelerated by rubbing. Bitterleaf was often applied after shedding to help the new scales acquire strength and shine.[16] At some point in time, kobolds learned to domesticate dire weasels to serve them as guards and hunters. This resulted in lycanthropic kobold dire weasels. Around one in ten thousand kobolds was a natural lycanthrope in this manner.[19] Kobolds often favored pack tactics. Kobolds used their cunning and sheer weight of numbers to defeat enemies. They preferred to lay traps or ambushes, and would only engage a foe directly after it was weakened. If their numbers were diminished such that they had less than a two-to-one advantage, the group would usually flee. Kobold traps included spike pits, tripwires, flaming oil, and poisonous vermin.[4] They disliked gnomes to such an extent that they would attack on sight.[10] Kobolds would usually loot what treasure they could carry from their defeated enemies, who were usually killed. Occasionally, kobolds would enslave their foes, who then might be sold on, unless they were gnomes, which kobolds would always kill, but never eat.[10] Kobolds lived in the dark, ideally underground or thick forest,[4] in tribal societies.[13] Their lairs were often overcrowded, although when one tribe became too numerous, it split into numerous smaller ones. The overcrowding eliminated the concept of privacy, so kobolds slept in communal areas where nudity was not regarded as shameful or offensive, even to the opposite sex. Kobolds wore clothing for function or ritual, but not to prevent nudity. The common overcrowding often led to conflict, and two kobolds would fight to settle their differences, although these fights were not usually lethal. This led to a lack of deep-rooted divisions or grievances in kobold society.[11] They were respectful of authority figures, and would obey diligently, particularly when their ruler was of lawful evil alignment.[15] A kobold sorcerer (with fake wings). Kobolds had specialized laborers, yet the majority of kobolds were miners. They possessed darkvision and were particularly sensitive to bright light.[4] Kobolds preferred exile to execution, and in some disputes, kobolds would split tribes in order to spread their kind over a larger region.[citation needed] Kobolds had natural tendencies towards sorcery.[21] They could live up to 135 years,[10] and dragonwrought even longer.[12] Kobolds were similar to dragons, but while dragons had warm blood, kobolds were cold-blooded. Due to this, they were susceptible to cold, especially if it was brought on quickly.[12] They enjoyed swimming and would gather to bathe together, especially after shedding (see below). Kobolds would take a lot of care maintaining their claws and teeth, using smooth stones to polish claws and chewing roots to clean teeth.[16] It was unknown how kobolds were of dragon heritage. While each kobold valued its own life, the tribe came first. They considered the success of their tribe to be their own success.[11] Kobolds did not maintain monogamous relationships, and due to the importance they placed on propagation, they chose mates by practical measures rather than love or other emotions. Mating was an impersonal act for kobolds.[11] Kobolds spoke Yipyak[8], a version of the Draconic language, with a yipping accent.[10] Some could also speak Undercommon.[22][note 1] Kobolds often created their lairs by mining them from the rock. Mining was a meticulously planned and conducted process where nothing was left to chance. Divination magic was used to locate ore and mineral deposits. A high proportion of a kobold tribe were miners. Each family group was expected to cut its own room, the walls of which they would adorn with a pictorial history of the family.[23] Kobolds preparing to activate a trap A kobold inventor. The greatest art for kobolds was trapmaking. The use of invention and cunning in traps was the mark of a good trapmaker. The other art form was the pictorial representation of the tribe's history, created on the walls of a specially created room in every lair. Kobolds enjoyed making jewelry from the gems and precious metals they encountered while mining. They could be possessive about their personal jewelry collections, and much effort was put into crafting beautiful jewelry, unlike other items, which were functional rather than aesthetically pleasing.[23] A group of kobolds returning from a heist. Most kobolds were miners and so dressed in sleeveless tunics and breeches; but kobolds enjoyed dressing in more elegant clothing for festivities. These included clothes made from silk or leather, but tailored clothes were only common among leaders. Garments were often made to compliment the wearer's eyes, which involved the use of orange or red dyes. Other garments might be dyed to demonstrate the wearer's affinity to a particular kind of dragon. Kobolds required the dexterity in their feet too often to wear footwear, and the soles of their feet were hard enough to cope with most surfaces. Due to the amount of time kobolds spend mining, gemstones were readily available, and they used these to adorn their clothing, and to make jewelry.[16] The main deity of the kobolds was Kurtulmak, the god of war and mining, who hates all living things besides their kin.[4] A main part of their religion was to seek out magic items that they believed may help free Kurtulmak from his eternal prison.[10] The other main god worshiped by the kobolds was Gaknulak, the god of protection, stealth, trickery and traps. A lesser-known kobold demigod was Dakarnok. The remainder of the kobold pantheon was comprised of deified kobold heroes.[15] Kobolds were also known for serving dragons and praising them as gods. A kobold tribe would present a dragon with tributes and sacrifices and whatever they thought it may like; they might have even seen it as a great honor to be devoured by the creature. If a kobold tribe was not accepted by a dragon they might start working for it in secret. Once a tribe settled to serve a dragon, their entire existence was to serve their god in every way.[24] Kobolds were omnivorous, eating plants and animals, but would not refuse to eat intelligent creatures if the opportunity presented itself.[4] They were able to eat just about anything when the situation became desperate, even tree bark or bone. Due to their cold-blooded nature, kobolds that had spent time in a warm place would not need to eat for days.[25] Kobolds held a hatred for nearly all other humanoid races and enjoyed killing and torturing them, in particular brownies, gnomes, pixies and sprites.[13] Kobolds were known to use dire weasels as mounts.[26] Kobolds were the first of the dragonspawn and were created by Asgorath (another name for Io) alongside urds around \u221224,500 DR.[27] They lived under Kurtulmak in Darastrixhurthi, a vassal state of Darastriverthicha, a nation ruled by the green dragon Caesinsjach. They found the gems in which the souls of the gnomes waited to be turned into living creatures and enslaved those who already lived. When the elves caused the Rage of Dragons, their dragon turned on them, and Garl Glittergold took this chance to kill Kurtulmak and the kobolds by collapsing the cavern in which their nation lay.[27] A blue dragonwrought kobold called Kuraulyek took the urds and fled out of egoism to the Thunder Peaks against Kurtulmak's orders to protect the kobolds against their mad master. This led to the near extinction of the entire kobold race. Io subsequently elevated Kurtulmak to deity status as leader of the kobolds, but also elevated Kuraulyek both as reparation but also to ensure the continued existence of the race. Kurtulmak learned about Kuraulyek's actions, and since then it was said that the latter was hiding from the former out of fear of reprisal.[27]   Dragonbloods: Draconic creature \u2022 Dragonborn of Bahamut \u2022 Dragonspawn\nDrow-dragon (shadow) \u2022 Drow-dragon (deep) \u2022 Half-dragon \u2022 Kobold (Dragonwrought \u2022 Urd) \u2022 Weredragon \u2022 Zar'ithra \u2022 Zekyl\nHybrid monsters: Dracimera \u2022 Mantidrake \u2022 Wyvern drake",

        "description": "   Krakens were feared across the known world. They were creatures that dwell in the depths of the ocean and came to the surface to prey upon ships and their crews.[citation needed]    They were akin to squids except larger in size, with a body almost 30\u202ffeet (9.1\u202fmeters) long. They had a similar body, with a ring of tentacles surrounding a mouth connected to a conical central body. Two of its ten tentacles were longer than the rest and had deadly barbs. The kraken had very large eyes, and fins protruded from the upper part of its elongated central body.[4] When younger, krakens resembled a pale squid.[10] Their massive tentacles could crush the hull of a galleon. The average kraken was about 100\u202ffeet (30\u202fmeters) in length and weighed about 4,000\u202fpounds (1,800\u202fkilograms).[citation needed] Krakens were highly destructive and evil creatures. With their strong tentacles and massive strength, they could pull an entire ship down into the ocean. They often completely wiped tropical islands of all life, and deep beneath the ocean, they had cavernous lairs where they bred human slaves to feed and tend them.[4] While the kraken itself was quite powerful, many never saw the creature's body. It hid below the surface of the water, where it could be protected from any attacks by a ship's defenders. The kraken instead sent forth its massive tentacles to catch crewmen and drag them below the water, where the beast could devour the unfortunate souls in one gulp.[citation needed] Krakens attacked predominantly with their tentacles. They could both constrict opponents and bring them into the reach of the creature's huge jaws. In addition, krakens could also release an enormous cloud of jet-black ink, regenerate severed limbs, and even cast spells.[4] A juvenile kraken. Krakens could speak some languages of surface-dwelling races but most commonly spoke Common, Aquan,[4] or a language of their own similar to that of whales.[citation needed] In the area around Ser\u00f4s krakens were known to be actively hunted by both storm giants and merrows, keeping their population low.[11] Krakens were supposedly once the rulers of the sea, but eventually the forces of good drove them back, though legends said they would one day rise again.[citation needed] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

Most lamias appeared to be beautiful women from the waist up but had the bodies of powerful lions from the waist down. However, these were the weakest forms of lamia. Lamia nobles had the lower bodies of serpents, which often led to them being confused with naga, yuan-ti abominations, or medusas.[7] The most powerful of lamias could change their lower bodies as easily as a mortal being changed their clothes.[citation needed] The lower body of a lamia could also resemble other animals such as goats and deer. The upper body of a lamia was that of a human torso that did not have animalistic features such as scales, horns, or fur.[3] Lamias were sinister creatures who lived in desert ruins. They sustained themselves by eating human flesh. They use a variety of abilities, including seduction, disguise, ventriloquism, illusions, mirages, mirror images and other such things, to lure, entice and confuse those who wandered into their midst into dangerous situations. When they secured their victim, they carved a feast out of them with curved daggers. Lamias did not wear any form of clothing or other adornment. They seemed devoted to chaos and destruction in their native habitats. They never ventured more than ten miles (16km) from their lairs. Lamias also had the ability to drain wisdom with their touch.[3] Lamia society was matriarchal, believing males were good for nothing more than breeding and slave labor.[3] Lamias sought to live in excess, surrounding themselves with beauty and slaves. They were highly sexual creatures and mated often with captured males to produce offspring.[3] Lamias followed the most powerful member of their community. They made their lairs within ancient ruins and abandoned cities. In these lairs, they used their illusory powers to transform the environment to appear new as if rebuilt to their former glory.[3] One type of rarer lamia was the lamia noble. These beings ruled over other lamias and the locations they inhabited. Unlike normal lamias, they had the lower bodies of serpents. Males fought with curved swords and magic, while females only used magic. Lamia nobles were also capable of venturing further from their lairs than other lamias, and prefered to go into urbanized areas in the guise of a human to infiltrate human and demihuman societies. Lamia nobles were prone to outbursts of senseless violence. [3] They could speak many different languages.[3] The lamia of the desert of Anauroch worshiped a wide variety of gods, including some human ones, but they were seeking for a \"true faith\" of their own.[8] The Demonomicon of Iggwilv claimed that the ancient obyrith Pale Night was the mother of the lamia race.[9] ",

        "description": "   Classifed as least devils by some scholars[11][12][13] but not even worthy of classification by most others,[8][11][14][15][16] lemures were at the bottom of the infernal hierarchy, sitting just below the bloated nupperibos.[11][12][8][14][13] Lemures were hideous, 5\u202fft (1.5\u202fm) tall blobs of molten, stinking flesh that oozed across the ground as they moved.[10][6] They were a formless, shivering, 100\u202flb (45\u202fkg) mass below their waists but their heads and torsos were of a vaguely humanoid shape.[6][18] Even as their facial features melted and shifted they maintained a permanent expression of horror and anguish, with most constantly gibbering to themselves despite their inability to speak.[4][1] Although most were unrecognizable, a rare lemure showed some memory of their mortal life by occasionally making certain facial features or nervous twitches. Even if not made through expressions, some had vestiges of their past lives, such as small shreds of clothing still attached to their amorphous masses.[4] Over time, however, remnants of individuality would become less noticeable as they continued to endure their wretched existences.[19] Lemures were almost completely mindless and effectively incapable of making decisions, even those that concerned themselves.[20] They sought revenge against reality itself as they blamed all the cosmos for their current condition, violently lashing out at all beings, with only the forced telepathic mandates of their superiors able to restrain their thirst for vengeance.[6] They generally tried to avoid other devils and rampaged in their hordes.[4] No matter from what kind of soul a given lemure was created, they normally retained nothing of their old personality or memory, although rarely a minor remnant of their memories would still be present. However, despite their mindlessness, they were capable of a primary motivation for promotion and the innate understanding that this would occur if they somehow proved themselves.[18][4] Lemures were hard to kill as they had an inherent and tenuous, if slow, regeneration ability. Even if turned into ash, they could fully regenerate over time. One way to permanently kill them was to use holy implements such as a holy weapon or holy water.[3] Another method was to eat them, the tactic that was both the most secure and most commonly used by demons.[21] Lemures had a complete immunity against any effects that attempted to tamper with their minds, due to not having minds to manipulate.[6] Lemures shambled forward in infernal legions at the command of their masters' telepathy, thoughtlessly slaughtering everything in their path and stopping only at the telepathic commands of their superiors.[6] They usually attacked their prey by clawing them apart or beating them into submission. They were individually weak and their tactics, or what passed as such, consisted of swarming their enemies and relying on their numbers, although they didn't always need great numbers to succeed.[3][1] Said numbers could reach more than a thousand under a single devil commander, allowing them to march in a special wedge formation called a \"battle drive\", which allowed them to hit more accurately.[3][1] The slowly crawling horde often, eventually, prevailed by virtue of sheer numbers, but commonly saw a 70-90% casualty rate, so the tactic was typically reserved for desperate battles when success was more important than the army's own longevity.[19] Lemures were the lowest of the baatezu, both regularly abused and lacking a true name. They were marshaled en masse by spinagons into the infernal armies that were thrown into the Blood War.[3][1][23] When not engaged in battle, lemures were left in the fiery spawning pits of Hell to torture any mortal souls that they found swimming amid the hellfire.[4] Lemures were suspected to be of infinite numbers and often wandered Avernus and Dis in massive hordes.[20] It was presumed that the mindlessness of the lemures was by design so that the baatezu could easily influence the lower caste into choosing the path of evil. With this mindlessness came also a lack of \"lesson\" that the lemure needed to learn if it wanted a promotion.[20] As low as a lemure's position was, they had a shot at a high position in the infernal hierarchy as any lemure was at least theoretically capable of rising through the ranks up to pit fiend rank and from there to higher nobility.[3] After becoming a lemure, the baatezu acknowledged the creature as part of their race and not as a petitioner, although they were still beneath notice.[20] They had not even truly begun the process of having their spirits expunged of the taint of chaos (and maybe even good).[24] The process was mostly randomized, however, based on the need of the promoter rather than the merit of the lemure, although occasionally such a process was used for amusement. When a lemure had the chance to be promoted to a spinagon, it sometimes had to fight against other lemures up for the position. After one won, its skin was taken away to reveal the form of a spinagon. It was also entirely possible the devil in charge of the fight would simply kill the winner if the fight failed to be entertaining. When a lemure did not manage to get a promotion, something that was effectively a matter of chance at their low station, it was over time absorbed into Baator like the petitioners they truly were.[18][25][4] Promotion at such a low level was something that could be done by a greater devil and was done when there was some demand for a specialized skill, such as the common transformation into an imp, or strangely into a wraith or spectre.[1][4] Conversely, it was entirely possible for a higher-ranking baatezu to commit such a severe crime that it was demoted to lemure status, causing them to lose all their memories.[1][25] When a soul arrived in Baator, they were shipped to torture stations and underwent a process of unimaginable agony, wracking their souls with pain, infusing them with fury and wringing them out of all their energy.[18][1] This often involved the use of a bed-like torture device known as a shriver that rended energy from mortal souls,[26] as well as the work of kyton and excruciarch teams to turn their petitioner victims into proto-lemures. Once completely drained of energy, the souls underwent arcane rituals that corrupted them with infernal power.[1][18] The process of lemure creation was concluded with dropping the proto-lemure into the Maggot Pit in Avernus, whereupon the drained husk would swiftly die before being reborn as a lemure. They could also be made from soul larvae, although, out of about a hundred thousand, only about a dozen were turned by the devils into lemures after a natural selection process. It was also possible for lemures to be made through demoting the nupperibos that naturally appeared from soul larvae. Occasionally, lemures even spontaneously pulled themselves from Baator itself although such an event was rare.[20] Souls that arrived in Baator because they were truly lawful evil rather than their dealings with the devils arrived through the River Styx.[27] Lemures needed more frequent but shorter rests than higher-ranking devils, stopping whenever they could to satisfy the five minutes they needed to be fully recovered. They were genderless devils that had no sex organs.[21] Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul",

        "description": "      Liches were generally gaunt and skeletal with withered flesh stretched tight across horribly visible bones but could vary greatly in appearance depending on their age. Some appeared as skeletons dressed in regal finery, yet others might appear to be nothing more than lepers. Bright pinpoints of crimson light burned in the empty sockets of those whose eyes had been destroyed or otherwise lost or were so old they had simply rotted away.[3] They were often clad in dark, tattered robes.[9] When moving, they seemed to glide as if floating on water.[10] Liches often did not have lips or the necessary organs to produce natural speech, but they had the ability to project speech from their mouths magically, moving the jaw (if present) to aid the illusion.[11] Because liches had eternal longevity, they often used this time to form schemes that took decades to develop, sometimes preferring to outlive a foe instead of confronting it, and as such most liches lived in secluded areas of Toril, where they were content with furthering whatever research or plots they had in motion.[12] The process of achieving lichdom required that the spellcaster construct a powerful magical artifact, a phylactery, in which the lich stored its life essence. As long as this phylactery was unharmed, the lich was immortal and would attempt to reassemble if it was ever vanquished (this happened within 10 days after its apparent destruction). It did not, however, grant any of the normal benefits of a phylactery until it was fully completed. For these reasons, liches took great care in protecting their phylactery from harm, employing decoys, traps, and other defenses.[3] The most common physical form for a phylactery was a sealed metal box containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases had been transcribed. Other forms of phylacteries existed, often small or tiny trinkets such as rings, amulets, or similar items. It could also take other shapes if the lich expended more gold and experience to make such alterations.[3] When the phylactery was created, the wizard transferred a bit of life force into the creation. While crafting the phylactery taxed the physical strength of the caster, the materials and components could easily exceed 120,000 gp. Overall, creating a phylactery was a very daunting task for anyone of arcane power.[3] A banelich and an alhoon. A dracolich. The ground-up bones of a lich were used as a component in the casting of the necromantic spell soul scour.[13] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

        "description": "      Male lions had large manes of golden fur. They were responsible for defending the pride against any attackers. Female lions, who had no manes, were the hunters of the pride. They used group tactics to hunt and provide food for the entire pride.. A male lion was 5\u20128\u202fft (1.5\u20122.4\u202fm) in length and weighed 330\u2012550\u202flb (150\u2012250\u202fkg). Females were slightly smaller.[2][6] Lions lived in prides of up twenty individuals, mostly females and their cubs. Each pride only had up to three adult male lions. Lions were obligate carnivores and hunted large animals such as giraffes and zebras. If necessary, they will hunt domesticated animals. They rarely hunted humanoids. The gestation period of a lion cub was approximately three months.[6][7] Lions were powerful and dangerous predators. Female lions hunted prey in packs, co-operating to drive their prey into a location ideal for ambush. Their long and sharp claws delivered devastating damage.[6] Their powerful hindquarters allowed a lion to jump up to 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm). Their sense were very sensitive and as a result, it was very difficult to sneak up on a lion. Lions avoided climbing and swimming.[6] Spotted lions were about thirty percent larger than the standard lion, and had a speckled outer coat. They roamed the plains and hills of the land, and exhibited similar form and behavior as other lions.[8] Fracto-Nimbuli, a cloud giant in Chondath, kept three spotted lions as pets.[9] A female lion from Neverwinter Nights. Among other places, wild lion prides were found in the wild grasslands surrounding the ancient city of Cursrah in the area that would later become the Calim Desert.[10] Lions were frequently found near the Well of the Cloven Rock, an oasis within Anauroch, when not hunting in the Hills of Scent.[11] Other locations there were known to inhabit were the Vilhon Reach[12] and the island of Storna.[13] The golden lion served as the currency of Cormyr.[14] In Tethyr, the Lion's Sword was the Tethyrian sword of state, wielded by princes and kings of the kingdom for centuries. In addition, the Monarch's Scepter, a unique rod of absorption that served as part of the regalia of the monarch of Tethyr, was a rod of pure silver, whose forward-oriented end was shaped to look like the head of a roaring lion.[15] Barachiel, a member of the Celestial Hebdomad and ruler of Lunia, used a lion as his symbol.[16] Nobanion was considered the deity of lions.[17] The faithful of Nobanion celebrated two festivals dedicated to lions, the Festival of the Pride and the Newborn Celebration.[12]. Lions were among the favored animals of Anhur.[18] Waukeen was often pictured with a pair of golden lions reclining at her feet. One of a set of matching lion statues was recovered from an abandoned temple to the Merchant's Friend in Tantras and taken to the Temple of Torm's Coming by Dunn Tenwealth during the Time of Troubles; it was this statue which Torm brought to life to prove himself to Adon, and which he later joined with his human avatar to become the giant, lion-headed man who fought and slew Bane in Tantras Harbor.[19] Chalsembyr's Heart, the sword which followers of Torm created to seek out the deity's lost kingdom from when he was a mortal, had cross guards shaped like lion's paws, and where they met the blade at the rain guard was an image of a lion's head, in profile on one side, face-on on the other.[20] Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold lion hides for 24 gp a piece.[21] Lions were raised from birth and trained to be companions and mounts in Turmish, even though this task was dangerous, laborious, time-consuming, and could cost a fortune.[22] Numerous locations were named after lions: Numerous organizations were named after lions: The entrance to the Shining Temple of Bishamon in Aru was guarded by massive lion statues, carved of ebony with eyes of gold and teeth of crystal.[35] An amulet of health often had the head of a lion engraved on one side.[36] Several years in the Roll of Years contain lions in their names: the Year of the Rearing Lion, 935 DR, the Year of the Lion's Heart, 1040 DR, the Year of Lions' Roars, 1071 DR, the Year of the Lion, 1340 DR, and the Year of the Lion Rampant, 1511 DR.

        "description": " This is a\nGood Article!  Blackscale\nPoison Dusk     Lizardfolk were semi-aquatic[9] reptilian humanoids. Their skin was covered in scales and varied in color from dark green through to shades of brown and gray. Taller than humans and powerfully built, lizardfolk were often between 6 and 7 feet (1.8\u20132.1 m) tall and weighed between 200 and 250 pounds (90.7\u2013113 kg).[8][3] Lizardfolk had non-prehensile muscular tails that grew to three or four feet in length, and these were used for balance.[9][3][8] They also had sharp claws and teeth.[3] Although non-reptilians struggled to tell the difference between males and females, lizardfolk could easily distinguish themselves.[8] Lizardfolk had to keep their skin relatively moist and needed to wet their bodies regularly if they were in dry climates. For this reason they were particularly fearful of desert landscapes.[12] Lizardfolk were strong and hardy beings, and their thick scaly hides protected against attack. They could hold their breaths far longer than humans could, up to twice as long as an equivalent human. This ability enabled them to operate underwater in their marshy homes.[7][6][3] The lizardfolk's tails aided them in keeping their balance and in leaping, and made them particularly gifted swimmers.[3][12] Lizardfolk were also noted to have darkvision.[7][note 1] Lizardfolk had no interest in money or jewels. They also did not much value accumulating knowledge if it was not practically useful. They largely valued things based on whether or not it was good to eat. If it was, it quickly got their attention; if not, it was ignored.[7] Lizardfolk could often become distracted at the appearance of food, even if they were in combat.[12] They were easier to parley with after a meal, and a hungry lizardfolk was completely obstreperous.[6] Lizardfolk could be highly dangerous when provoked.[3] However, they were not inherently evil; they were simply savage and had a hard time fitting in with the civilized world.[7] Those that ventured into towns or cities were often alarmed, frightened, or offended by the environment.[13] Few tried to adapt, let alone assimilate into Faer\u00fbnian societies. Instead, they felt their part was to learn about \"softskin\" ways and in turn show them how \"real people\" lived.[7][6] Lizardfolk females laid clutches of eggs, from which their young hatched. The eggs were kept well protected in the tribe's lair.[8] The life of a hatchling was especially hard.[7] Lizardfolk reached maturity within five years of hatching.[8] As lizardfolk aged, their bodies slowed down. Most lizardfolk over the age of 60 spent their days laying on warm rocks in the sun.[7] Although lizardfolk aged much the same and had a similar lifespan to humans\u2014the oldest reached 80 years of age\u2014it was rare for lizardfolk males to grow old as they usually died in combat long before.[8] Lizardfolk were quite diverse in their diet. Lizardfolk were omnivorous, but strongly favored meat when they could get it.[3][7] According to stories, to the lizardfolk, the most delicious meat was humanoid flesh, especially human,[7][3][4] but this claim was more-or-less unfounded. However, some tribes did consume captives and enemies slain in battle.[3] but more civilized tribes often resisted this craving.[9] Meanwhile, ritual cannibalism of deceased tribe-members was customary.[7] Lizardfolk were quick to consume anything that was edible. For this reason, lizardfolk never kept pets.[6] When hunters brought back prey, adult lizardfolk ate first, taking what they wished. The young were usually left with the scraps, and more often than not subsisted on edible plants foraged from around the tribe's lair.[7] A lizardfolk, armed to the teeth. Most lizardfolk had little interest in battle tactics or strategy, and they fought as a disorganized mass of individuals. Despite their impressive hunting skills, lizardfolk often relied on strength and weight of numbers in battle, and simply charged their foes head-on. At the most, they would try to push foes into water, where lizardfolk often enjoyed an advantage.[7][3] However, if lizardfolk were being attacked or pursued, or their camps were in danger or their territory invaded, their hunting skills came to the fore and they laid traps, snares, and pitfalls. They organized ambushes and raided enemy supplies. The more advanced tribes attempted cleverer strategies and traps. A great many lizardfolk lairs were defended by traps.[7][3] Lizardfolk gathered into tribes. A typical tribe might have 150 lizardfolk, with around 50 male, 50 female, and 50 hatchlings,[7] Another might have only 30\u201360 adults, with half as many hatchlings and one tenth that number in unhatched eggs.[3][7] Lizardfolk society was patriarchal and leaders held their positions for their strength and power alone.[7][3] Although challenges for leadership were rarely made, anyone in the tribe could try and seize power from the leader. This would leave the tribe unorganized and vulnerable until a new leader took charge or the old leader had reasserted their position.[7] Lizardfolk leaders were most often barbarians or even druids. In a tribe, they would be assisted by two lieutenants.[3] Many skilled warriors were fighters and barbarians.[7] Tribal shamans, meanwhile, were usually clerics who worshiped Semuanya. Shamans rarely served as leaders, and by-and-large only offered advice.[3][7] Females in the tribes were responsible for hatching eggs, raising young, and maintaining the camp. All the females in the tribe would work together to raise the young. They monitored their hatchlings closely, as the young were difficult to handle and tended to wander off, away from camp and into the wilderness.[7] Lizardfolk fashioned primitive weaponry and tools from wood, stones, and plants they found in the wetlands. Lizardfolk preferred weapons they could fashion themselves from what was available, and so they tended to be simple and limited in variety. More advanced tribes made use of a wider range of weaponry and shields. Moreover, they would sometimes utilize weapons they found or stole; tribal leaders typically got to use items that had been stolen or bartered from other races.[7][3][6] The barbed dart was a weapon unique to the lizardfolk.[6] However, their claws and teeth were often sufficient.[7][3] Camps varied in style from tribe to tribe. The simplest were just damp leaves used for bedding, but more developed lizardfolk tribes built crude dwellings.[3][7] They did not keep animals as pets or mounts, but rarely a lizardfolk druid might employ their magic to charm a dinosaur and ride it into battle to awesome effect.[6] A species of giant gourds was staple of the Lizard Marsh. These enormous edible fruits were hollowed and dried out by the lizardfolk of the Marsh, making them into oversized containers, often bigger than an adult human in size. These gourds were painted, decorated, and used to store various liquids, such as fresh water, fermented alcohol, and small swimming snacks.[15] A lizardfolk wielding a polearm and a shield. The lizardfolk had no traditions of farming, cultivation, or animal raising, so food was acquired through fishing, hunting, scavenging, or stealing. Those that dwelled near other humanoids raided their neighbors for food, supplies, and even slaves. The tribe's survival was its primary, or indeed, only concern. When they felt threatened, or when food shortages would lead to starvation, a tribe would do absolutely anything to guarantee its survival, even committing acts others would see as despicable.[8][3] Most lizardfolk were content to live their lives out in the swamps and marshes where they were born but, on occasion, some would venture outside their swampy homes to hunt bigger and more dangerous prey. Sometimes a lizardfolk even desired to know more about the outside world, but mostly to bring knowledge back to their leader. When they did so, lizardfolk rarely traveled alone. If they left the swamp, they would do so in pairs or groups of three. Lizardfolk feared that, without others of their own kind with them to remind them of who and what they were, they would lose their identity and be seduced by the ways of civilization and never come home again.[7] When a member of the tribe passed away, they were eaten by the others in a ceremonial wake. In this way, they became part of the tribe again, not just figuratively but literally.[7] Lizardfolk spoke Draconic[note 2] and smarter individuals sometimes learned bits of Common. Depending on where they lived, lizardfolk might learn other languages like Dwarven, Elven, Gnoll, Goblin, Orc, or other languages used in their area, and even Aquan. Most ordinary lizardfolk were illiterate.[7][3] Most lizardfolk worshiped Semuanya, who focused solely on the survival and propagation of the lizardfolk species.[3] This religion was maintained by clerics who served as tribal shamans; they bestowed Semuanya's blessings on the lizardfolk people whenever required. Although they had no shrines or temples, nor even regular ceremonies, lizardfolk were very proud of their religious traditions and their deity.[6] However, Semuanya was an uncaring and unfeeling god who dismissed even the suffering of his followers, expecting them to take care of themselves.[16][17][18] Thanks to Semuanya's close links to nature, and because lizardfolk were naturally close to the land, ready to take what it gave them, many lizardfolk had no problem shifting to worshiping nature itself. This led to a high number of lizardfolk druids.[7][6] However, the lizardfolk had other gods. Their original god was Essylliss, who focused on the lizardfolk themselves. But as Semuanya's influence grew, Essylliss's worship declined until he was almost forgotten. He was followed by a bare few lizardfolk.[18] There was also the cult of Sess'innek, a demon lord who represented dominion and his version of civilization. He sought to corrupt the lizardfolk, and created the demonic lizard kings to this end; they operated as tribal leaders or shamans. Sess'innek's followers were hostile, territorial, and greedy. They tried to convert all other lizardfolk to their cult, or else kill them off, and they attacked Semuanya's shamans on sight.[17][18] Lizardfolk generally inhabited marshes and swamps in the temperate and warm regions of Faer\u00fbn.[8] The majority dwelled in swamps in well-hidden lairs, but around a third of the lizardfolk population actually laired in underwater caves that were filled with air.[8][3] There were populations of lizardfolk in Chessenta and the Chondalwood, around the Lake of Steam and the Vilhon Reach, on the Nelanther Isles, and in the Western Heartlands. In particular, communities lived in the Deepwash, the Flooded Forest, the Marsh of Chelimber, the Marsh of Tun, and the Great Swamp of Rethild. Lizardfolk could also be found in the cooler swamps of the Sword Coast like the Lizard Marsh[8] and the swamps at the mouth of the Winding Water.[19] In Chult, lizardfolk could be seen on the shores of the River Olung.[20] Lizardfolk were also one of the major races on the inner planet Coliar, populating the earth islands of the gas giant. They showed great interest in spelljammer technology.[21] Neighboring lizardfolk tribes would often ally against formidable enemies, even against other hostile lizardfolk tribes.[3] The relationship of lizardfolk to other races was considered to be mostly that of hunter to prey. Lizardfolk of somewhat more civilized nature understood that other races might know something worth learning, and were ready to parley.[6] Lizardfolk were most likely to negotiate with halflings.[2] Nevertheless, lizardfolk considered themselves stronger and thus better than most other races[8] and therefore thought of themselves as \"real people\". Lizardfolk referred to most of the civilized races as \"softskins\".[7] Lizardfolk rarely interacted with other races as their swampy homelands were home to few other sentient creatures. Their main competitors in the swamps were bullywugs, whom lizardfolk tended to despise.[22] They sometimes allied with locathahs, or choose to serve highly dominant creatures like dragons or nagas.[3] In places where lizardfolk raiding parties threatened civilization, interracial relations could be particularly bad, In the coastal village of Lathtarl's Lantern the hunting of lizard folk became a sport.[23] In rare events when lizardfolk were aided by members of other humanoid races and became respected among a tribe, robed lizardfolk shamans created large enchanted amulets of bronze. These items were universally recognized by all lizardfolk and proclaimed that the wearer was a trusted friend. The amulet protected the wearer from any and all lizardmen attacks unless forced to defend themselves. The magics weaved by the lizardfolk were complex dweomers that made it instantly apparent if the medallion was copied. Additionally, these amulets were attuned to a specific wearer, making them useless when sold, gifted, or stolen.[24] The eggs and skin of lizardfolk were bitter and inedible.[4] The skin of lizardfolk could be fashioned into armor.[4] Lizardfolk conquer Marsember in 289 DR. The lizardfolk themselves had no written history. Lizardfolk themselves believed they were one of the first humanoid races on Toril. In their story, lizardfolk had dwelled in the swamps since the beginning and that all the civilized races outside had evolved from weak lizardfolk who could not endure their harsh life and left the swamps. Thus, the lizardfolk could look down upon the civilized races as weaklings.[8] Outsiders thought it more likely that lizardfolk were an offshoot of the ancient Creator Race known as the sarrukh, appearing long before any of the interloper races came to Toril.[8] Regardless, it was clear that lizardfolk had an unimaginably ancient culture, virtually unchanged over the eons.[8] In \u22121732 DR, the Lapal tribes imported large numbers of lizardfolk as slaves from the Great Swamp of Rethild. Many of the lizardfolk escaped into the land that would become Halruaa.[25] In \u2212189 DR, the armies of Serpentes conquered the Tashalar. The army was made up of lizardfolk and yuan-ti.[26] In 289 DR, lizardfolk claimed the flooded city of Marsember in Cormyr after King Torst and his brother were slain in the flooding.[27] In 993 DR, several lizardfolk tribes migrated eastward from Serpent Hills into the newly formed Marsh of Chelimber.[28] In 1330 DR, the community of Reeshov saw an influx in lizardfolk after the creatures were freed from mind flayer control.[29]",

        "description": " This is a\nGood Article!  Blackscale\nPoison Dusk     Lizardfolk were semi-aquatic[9] reptilian humanoids. Their skin was covered in scales and varied in color from dark green through to shades of brown and gray. Taller than humans and powerfully built, lizardfolk were often between 6 and 7 feet (1.8\u20132.1 m) tall and weighed between 200 and 250 pounds (90.7\u2013113 kg).[8][3] Lizardfolk had non-prehensile muscular tails that grew to three or four feet in length, and these were used for balance.[9][3][8] They also had sharp claws and teeth.[3] Although non-reptilians struggled to tell the difference between males and females, lizardfolk could easily distinguish themselves.[8] Lizardfolk had to keep their skin relatively moist and needed to wet their bodies regularly if they were in dry climates. For this reason they were particularly fearful of desert landscapes.[12] Lizardfolk were strong and hardy beings, and their thick scaly hides protected against attack. They could hold their breaths far longer than humans could, up to twice as long as an equivalent human. This ability enabled them to operate underwater in their marshy homes.[7][6][3] The lizardfolk's tails aided them in keeping their balance and in leaping, and made them particularly gifted swimmers.[3][12] Lizardfolk were also noted to have darkvision.[7][note 1] Lizardfolk had no interest in money or jewels. They also did not much value accumulating knowledge if it was not practically useful. They largely valued things based on whether or not it was good to eat. If it was, it quickly got their attention; if not, it was ignored.[7] Lizardfolk could often become distracted at the appearance of food, even if they were in combat.[12] They were easier to parley with after a meal, and a hungry lizardfolk was completely obstreperous.[6] Lizardfolk could be highly dangerous when provoked.[3] However, they were not inherently evil; they were simply savage and had a hard time fitting in with the civilized world.[7] Those that ventured into towns or cities were often alarmed, frightened, or offended by the environment.[13] Few tried to adapt, let alone assimilate into Faer\u00fbnian societies. Instead, they felt their part was to learn about \"softskin\" ways and in turn show them how \"real people\" lived.[7][6] Lizardfolk females laid clutches of eggs, from which their young hatched. The eggs were kept well protected in the tribe's lair.[8] The life of a hatchling was especially hard.[7] Lizardfolk reached maturity within five years of hatching.[8] As lizardfolk aged, their bodies slowed down. Most lizardfolk over the age of 60 spent their days laying on warm rocks in the sun.[7] Although lizardfolk aged much the same and had a similar lifespan to humans\u2014the oldest reached 80 years of age\u2014it was rare for lizardfolk males to grow old as they usually died in combat long before.[8] Lizardfolk were quite diverse in their diet. Lizardfolk were omnivorous, but strongly favored meat when they could get it.[3][7] According to stories, to the lizardfolk, the most delicious meat was humanoid flesh, especially human,[7][3][4] but this claim was more-or-less unfounded. However, some tribes did consume captives and enemies slain in battle.[3] but more civilized tribes often resisted this craving.[9] Meanwhile, ritual cannibalism of deceased tribe-members was customary.[7] Lizardfolk were quick to consume anything that was edible. For this reason, lizardfolk never kept pets.[6] When hunters brought back prey, adult lizardfolk ate first, taking what they wished. The young were usually left with the scraps, and more often than not subsisted on edible plants foraged from around the tribe's lair.[7] A lizardfolk, armed to the teeth. Most lizardfolk had little interest in battle tactics or strategy, and they fought as a disorganized mass of individuals. Despite their impressive hunting skills, lizardfolk often relied on strength and weight of numbers in battle, and simply charged their foes head-on. At the most, they would try to push foes into water, where lizardfolk often enjoyed an advantage.[7][3] However, if lizardfolk were being attacked or pursued, or their camps were in danger or their territory invaded, their hunting skills came to the fore and they laid traps, snares, and pitfalls. They organized ambushes and raided enemy supplies. The more advanced tribes attempted cleverer strategies and traps. A great many lizardfolk lairs were defended by traps.[7][3] Lizardfolk gathered into tribes. A typical tribe might have 150 lizardfolk, with around 50 male, 50 female, and 50 hatchlings,[7] Another might have only 30\u201360 adults, with half as many hatchlings and one tenth that number in unhatched eggs.[3][7] Lizardfolk society was patriarchal and leaders held their positions for their strength and power alone.[7][3] Although challenges for leadership were rarely made, anyone in the tribe could try and seize power from the leader. This would leave the tribe unorganized and vulnerable until a new leader took charge or the old leader had reasserted their position.[7] Lizardfolk leaders were most often barbarians or even druids. In a tribe, they would be assisted by two lieutenants.[3] Many skilled warriors were fighters and barbarians.[7] Tribal shamans, meanwhile, were usually clerics who worshiped Semuanya. Shamans rarely served as leaders, and by-and-large only offered advice.[3][7] Females in the tribes were responsible for hatching eggs, raising young, and maintaining the camp. All the females in the tribe would work together to raise the young. They monitored their hatchlings closely, as the young were difficult to handle and tended to wander off, away from camp and into the wilderness.[7] Lizardfolk fashioned primitive weaponry and tools from wood, stones, and plants they found in the wetlands. Lizardfolk preferred weapons they could fashion themselves from what was available, and so they tended to be simple and limited in variety. More advanced tribes made use of a wider range of weaponry and shields. Moreover, they would sometimes utilize weapons they found or stole; tribal leaders typically got to use items that had been stolen or bartered from other races.[7][3][6] The barbed dart was a weapon unique to the lizardfolk.[6] However, their claws and teeth were often sufficient.[7][3] Camps varied in style from tribe to tribe. The simplest were just damp leaves used for bedding, but more developed lizardfolk tribes built crude dwellings.[3][7] They did not keep animals as pets or mounts, but rarely a lizardfolk druid might employ their magic to charm a dinosaur and ride it into battle to awesome effect.[6] A species of giant gourds was staple of the Lizard Marsh. These enormous edible fruits were hollowed and dried out by the lizardfolk of the Marsh, making them into oversized containers, often bigger than an adult human in size. These gourds were painted, decorated, and used to store various liquids, such as fresh water, fermented alcohol, and small swimming snacks.[15] A lizardfolk wielding a polearm and a shield. The lizardfolk had no traditions of farming, cultivation, or animal raising, so food was acquired through fishing, hunting, scavenging, or stealing. Those that dwelled near other humanoids raided their neighbors for food, supplies, and even slaves. The tribe's survival was its primary, or indeed, only concern. When they felt threatened, or when food shortages would lead to starvation, a tribe would do absolutely anything to guarantee its survival, even committing acts others would see as despicable.[8][3] Most lizardfolk were content to live their lives out in the swamps and marshes where they were born but, on occasion, some would venture outside their swampy homes to hunt bigger and more dangerous prey. Sometimes a lizardfolk even desired to know more about the outside world, but mostly to bring knowledge back to their leader. When they did so, lizardfolk rarely traveled alone. If they left the swamp, they would do so in pairs or groups of three. Lizardfolk feared that, without others of their own kind with them to remind them of who and what they were, they would lose their identity and be seduced by the ways of civilization and never come home again.[7] When a member of the tribe passed away, they were eaten by the others in a ceremonial wake. In this way, they became part of the tribe again, not just figuratively but literally.[7] Lizardfolk spoke Draconic[note 2] and smarter individuals sometimes learned bits of Common. Depending on where they lived, lizardfolk might learn other languages like Dwarven, Elven, Gnoll, Goblin, Orc, or other languages used in their area, and even Aquan. Most ordinary lizardfolk were illiterate.[7][3] Most lizardfolk worshiped Semuanya, who focused solely on the survival and propagation of the lizardfolk species.[3] This religion was maintained by clerics who served as tribal shamans; they bestowed Semuanya's blessings on the lizardfolk people whenever required. Although they had no shrines or temples, nor even regular ceremonies, lizardfolk were very proud of their religious traditions and their deity.[6] However, Semuanya was an uncaring and unfeeling god who dismissed even the suffering of his followers, expecting them to take care of themselves.[16][17][18] Thanks to Semuanya's close links to nature, and because lizardfolk were naturally close to the land, ready to take what it gave them, many lizardfolk had no problem shifting to worshiping nature itself.

        "description": "   Wizards were generally the best-respected of all arcane spellcasters since they usually had a measure of discipline that was uncommon among other arcane spellcasters, particularly sorcerers or warlocks whose very nature made them comparatively unruly. Not all wizards were deserving of this reputation, however, and wizards could be as easily chaotic or evil as any other class. Prior to the Spellplague, wizards as a whole were associated with the good goddess Mystra, whom many worshiped, though Mystra's death had ended this. Others worshiped Mystra's evil adversary, Shar, the goddess of darkness, giving them an entirely different reputation. With the return of Mystra after the Second Sundering, wizards once again fell under her purview.[12] Elminster Aumar, the Sage of Shadowdale, was by far the best-known example of a wizard.[13]    The mark of a wizard. Wizards had a wide variety of powers called spells available to them, fueled by the arcane energy of the universe. Prior to the Spellplague, these powers flowed from the Weave, which was governed by the goddess Mystryl, followed by Mystra, and then by Midnight. Since the Spellplague, magic no longer requires a god's governance, though many gods remained associated with arcane magic. A wizard's spells differed from those of other arcane spellcasters usually in terms of usage or scale. While a warlock's spells were primarily malevolent and a swordmage might use defensive spells that empowered themselves, a wizard used their power to control the nature of a battle, a landscape, or even the physical makeup of the universe itself. When in combat, a wizard favored spells that hindered many enemies at once, rather than attacking one, or that empowered themselves or allies.[14] When casting spells, wizards often used arcane foci, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands.[15] These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically.[16] Wizards were also skilled in the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells which a wizard can only master once per day), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual. [17] A familiar was a normal animal that gained new powers and became a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. Wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. In particular, they learn most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their spellbooks, a method that allows them, unlike bards or sorcerers, to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards see themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, and scientists, studying a system of natural laws that are for the most part unknown and undiscovered. This is the common view of a wizard casting: voicing several strange words, utilizing some arcane component (such as tossing pixie dust into the air), and perhaps making some sort of quirky hand movement. In actuality every part of the sequence must be exact or else the wizard may miscast, misfire, cast an entirely different spell, or cast nothing at all. A wizard still in his apprentice stage. Wizards may specialize in one or more of eight schools of magic, choosing their specialty early on in their training. This specialization is sometimes required in order to join the ranks of some of the world's most prestigious wizards, such as the Red Wizards of Thay, who require all initiates to be specialized in one of the schools of magic. Specialist wizards are treated and regarded as wizards by the world at large in spite of this specialization and many regarded themselves as such, though sometimes distinctions are made for diviners, illusionists, and necromancers. Some Elves, Half-elves, and Gnomes in the past practiced Dualism, specializing exclusively in two opposing schools to the exclusion of all others. Nonetheless, all of the following are simply considered wizard variants by the magic casting community. Wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or interact with other spells, are known as abjurers. These wizards are usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. Abjurers like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters.[19] Abjurers in battle are not as much a danger to those who forego magic for martial combat but those who use arcane or even divine spells will find abjurers deadly opponents. As aforementioned abjurers are often well-prepared for combating spellcasters of all stripes and are a valuable addition to any team intent on fighting wielders of supernatural abilities. Because of their propensity for deliberant action more abjurers are lawful than not, though any alignment is possible. While abjurer's care and disdain for reckless action makes many good some are drawn to their talents by promises of power over other spellcasters. Abjurers only reluctantly adventure and are most often found in small villages where they enjoy the trust and good regards of friends and neighbors.[19] Conjurers are wizards who specialize in conjuration, the magical art of summoning and teleportation. Conjurers are often headstrong and disdainful towards other schools of magic, seeing most as weak or inconsequential, with the exception of necromancy, which they hold to be repulsive. Conjurers can be difficult companions since many are so independent-minded that only an unusually strong-willed leader can earn their respect.[19] Stereotypes of conjurers and sorcerers are often similar, with the reputation of conjurers being that they tend to see magic as a blunt instrument. In battle, conjurers do tend to be unflinching in danger, confident in their summoned power to overcome any threat.[19] The typical conjurer is chaotic in alignment and in a reversal of the wizard stereotype favor quick and easy solutions over long and carefully planned out ones. Many are also evil or neutral, unperturbed by paths to power that involve unsavory, evil or outright despicable methods. Most conjurers like isolation, as it means they can carry out their dangerous experiments undisturbed by others and only leave their enclaves either to accumulate more power or the necessary wealth to continue their research.[19] Those wizards who specialize in the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or a far away location, are known as diviners. Diviners are notable for possessing an unusually high wisdom for wizards, with strong and cautious judgment, preferring to use violence only as a last resort.[20] Many diviners are also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all matters.[21] Diviners are not necessarily cowards but exhaust all other options before proceeding into combat. While diviners can be useful due to their anticipation of others' attacks some are irritatingly hesitant, making them nigh useless at times.[21] When forced into battle, diviners are in natural opposition to illusionists, whose tricks they can unravel with their own spells. Because of their deliberate approach to matters most diviners are lawful, though their tendency towards inaction also makes many neutral. Diviners are not often adventurers, in part because of their loner nature, but when they are they are highly valued. Good diviners use their foresight to prevent harm from coming to others while evil ones can use it obtain control over others. Diviners of all stripes often cover their costs by serving as seers or fortunetellers.[21] An eccentric apprentice. Enchantment, also known as charming, is the arcane art of influencing or controlling the actions of others and enchanters are those wizards who specialize in the school. More than a few enchanters have an unusually high charisma and degree of charm about them for a wizard, possessing a naturally outgoing and attractive personality. Even if they lack charisma however, enchanters can sway the opinions or actions of others - so long as they cast a charm spell first, which draws on their intelligence.[21] Enchanters work with their allies more closely than some of the more single-minded wizard variants and this is one of their strengths. Enchanters use their spells to overcome social obstacles, convince enemies to lay down arms, or put foes into a daze. The most dangerous ability of an enchanter is their ability to turn an enemy into an ally, or vice versa, or to incapacitate an enemy in such a way that renders them as good as dead.[21] Enchanters can be good or evil and have no overall strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters are chaotic over evil, though only by a slim margin. Good enchanters are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another's being's free will, while evil enchanters show little such restraint. Enchanters of all kinds enjoy company and typically are found in large cities rather than small communities where their talents are put to little use. [21] Evocation magic is a unique blend of arcane magic with the elemental power of creation and those who specialize in it are known as evokers. Evokers are often stubbornly determined by nature and have little use for distractions of the real world, living in very often spartan conditions. Many evokers are decisive and forthright, who are sure of what they must do, be it good or evil, giving them many qualities of strong leadership.[21] Evokers are naturally adept at combat, making them some of the most common wizard adventurers. Most evocation spells have an immediately obvious combat application, such as magic missile or fireball and make evokers valued combatants who often serve as a form of magical artillery on the battlefield.[21] Evokers have no strong tendencies towards law or chaos and both good and evil evokers are common. Good evokers perceive evil as a force that must immediately be opposed by their power and evil evokers find evocation magic a fast and comparatively easy way to power. In spite of the sheer lack of subtlety in many evocation spells, or perhaps because of it, most evokers live in small and quiet homes or even as hermits. This is perhaps for the best and many, sometimes rightly, fear the power evokers can wield.[21] An illusionist, battling a gnoll. Wizards specializing in illusion magic, known as illusionists, are one of the most well-known wizard variants, valued as entertainers in the world. Many illusionists are flamboyant and outgoing, with a streak of hedonism.[21] More creative than most other wizards or even other arcane spellcasters, illusionists as a rule enjoy art of all forms and are less interested in scholarly research and more so in a hands-on approach through experimentation.[22] However, illusionists are not merely clowns and can be deadly adversaries when they choose to be. Illusionists use their power to play tricks on their enemies and toy with them, casting illusive images or sounds that confuse and befuddle the mind of a foe, turning their own senses into a weapon against them. Sometimes an illusion is so powerful and realistic it actually \"fools\" an enemy into death and injury.[23] Evil illusionists are therefore a very real and often frightening menace.[24] Illusionists are, like all skilled wizards, highly intelligent but they usually aren't very reflective. Pragmatically, most accept the impermanence of life in general and see efforts to adhere to a single strong philosophy as futile and as such have no strong alignment tendencies.[24] While many who wield necrotic magic are practitioners of shadow magic, necromancy is also a path open to many wizards. Often brooding and humorless these wizards are obsessed with death in a manner most other people find disturbing. Most necromantic wizards approach life with a stoic and thoughtful attitude and can, despite first impressions, be loyal and faithful companions though many prefer solitude.[24] Necromantic wizards, while usually not very sociable, are valued party members. This is in large part due to the sheer lethality of powers wielded by a trained necromancer. Likewise, necromantic wizards have a generally fearless attitude towards death, though not all too often to the point of recklessness, which again increases their value as allies.[24] Evil necromantic wizards by far outnumber good ones, as playing with the forces of death and undeath is hardly something to be done as lightly as many necromancers do. Necromantic wizards often feel an allure to order, but many chaotic examples do exist. Truly unaligned necromancers are extremely rare, since either a necromancer has a strong devotion to good or falls into evil. Most necromancers are loners by nature and when not adventuring prefer to immerse themselves in their research[24] Transmutation is the ability to shape objects' physical makeup through magic and transmuters are those who specialize in the art. Transmuters are typically more curious than other wizards, marked by a fascination with how things go together and are, likewise, torn apart. This makes many transmuters ardent collectors of magical items and artifacts, as well as clear thinkers, though they often lack an insight into why things are rather than just how.[24] Transmuters have many useful combat applications for their spells, since they can transform the nature of virtually any object. A transmuter might, for instance, transform an enemy into a frog or an ally into a powerful monster. Transmuters can also use their spells to increase the abilities of their allies or themselves, giving them abilities that parallel in many ways those of artificers, who likewise specialize in manipulating the physical world through magic. Many transmuters are chaotic, since chaos is the very essence of change and transmuters specialize in making things go through such a process. However, lawful transmuters do exist. Good, neutral, and evil transmuters are all roughly equal in number, with good transmuters viewing their abilities as a way to change things for the better and evil ones tend to see morality as an inherently changing and relative concept inconsequential to their work. Transmuters are more adventuresome than other wizards and can often be found exploring the world.[24] Some wizards, occasionally known as generalists, are less inclined to specialize in the various schools of magic. These individuals instead prefer to use a wide variety of spells, with no limitations on which spells they can or cannot cast other than lack of knowledge. These wizards tend to fall into a number of sub-categories, which are listed below. Favoring battle from as great of a distance as reasonable, control wizards prefer spells that hinder or restrict their enemies rather than those that are particularly deadly. Like all wizards, control wizards are highly intelligent, but they also put a high value upon possessing strong judgment and willpower, which can help control wizards to maintain their spells' effects for longer periods of time, particularly if they happen to be adept at using orbs as implements. Some control wizards prefer to use staffs for the purpose of defense and put an emphasis on their physical fortitude in addition to their mental faculties, so as to make them more durable against their enemies. Many of the spells used by control wizards are from the conjuration or enchantment schools, though not all.[25] War wizards, not to be confused with the well known War Wizards of Cormyr, are those non-specialized wizards who prefer power to delicacy. War wizards prefer to use spells that deal damage in large amounts. Many of their spells hail from the evocation school, though others are from the conjuration or transmutation schools. Like their fellow mages, war wizards are highly intelligent but dexterity follows very shortly thereafter in importance, particularly since many war wizards choose to use wands to enhance their accuracy. Other use staffs for the purpose of defense and put a high emphasis on their constitution.[25]",

Their breath weapon consisted of a molten blob of lava which hit a single designated target. If they were encountered in a volcanic region, they regenerated health every few seconds.

        "description": "   Magmen were 3\u20134 feet (0.9\u20131.2 meters) tall and weighed 400 pounds (180 kilograms).[4][2] They were squat and stubby humanoids, seemingly sculpted from hardened magma with gleeful yet mischievous smiles. Underneath their shells, they seemed composed of flowing lava and seething flame. Each magmin radiated a small amount of heat and light, with small bursts of flames constantly erupting from the surface of their skin.[2] If out of lava for too long, magmen would soon stiffen and harden, becoming immobile.[4] Magmins were not particularly intelligent and remained oblivious to the harm their abilities posed to other races on the material plane. Both vexing and capricious, magmen enjoyed watching material creatures flee the environment they considered painless. Despite their love of chaos and destruction, they were not malicious in their burning, and did not properly understand the deadly nature of their flames.[2][1] The utterly alien concept that fire was linked to pain, and their preoccupation with having fun led them to view mortal reactions as slapstick. It was practically impossible to coerce them not to set things alight, with the only nonviolent solution being to bribe them with other targets or food.[3] By their touch alone, magmen could cause flammable objects and creatures to burst into flames, although the black shell that enveloped them prevented them from burning everything they touched. By shedding their shell, they could become far more dangerous, shining brightly and exuding extreme levels of heat.[1] Their touch was hot enough that conventional metal weapons were ineffective, melting as they struck their bodies.[2] The nature of their bodies was inherently destructive, bursting into flames and lava upon death.[1] Magmins did not attack creatures in the sense that they did not intentionally cause physical harm. They did not seek out combat, but lit creatures they came across on fire for their amusement.[2] If significantly hurt, they would not stay and fight but would quickly retreat.[1] When confronted by entities that could not be harmed by heat, magmen would be forced to rely on slamming and punching. Once harmed, they would only retreat far enough to attempt an ambush, but failing this they would simply try to escape, only continuing battle if cornered.[4] Within the Fountains of Creation magmen lived in small tribes formed around a base colony led by the oldest magmen. They lived as hunter-gatherers, scouring the plains of magma for choice pieces of burning minerals and hunting other elemental beings.[3] Magmen enjoyed swimming in active volcanoes, especially because when they erupted the magmen could spread and set fire to all around the area.[4] Occasionally they were found on other Inner Planes and the Prime Material due to elemental vortices created from the excessive heat and high pressure of subterranean lava. These vortices had a strong allure to magmen as the magma of different planes had varying tastes. It was unknown if they actually consumed these choice bits of maga or if they simply drew them in from their skin. Some sages speculated that the odd minerals found in the portals to other planes had an intoxicating effect, resulting in their mischievous behavior.[3] To magmen, any temperature below 1000\u2009\u2109 (540\u2009\u2103) was considered cold, and their bodies would harden if kept away from extreme heat for more than 6 hours. Typically, they only left the magma for under 2\u20133 hours.[4]  Magmen did not have sexes, reproducing through simple division.[4] Magmen lacked knowledge of any Material Plane languages, knowing only the language of Ignan.[1]  The only time magmen appeared in the material plane outside of their own volition was if a summoner conjured them to spread havoc. Both tanar'ri and baatezu summoned magmen in special molten pools as their mischievous love of destruction was a source of entertainment. Occasionally they were called to cause mayhem as a diversionary tactic during the Blood War but their unwillingness to fight limited their combat utility.[3] Sometimes wizards would use magmen as fire for their furnaces to conduct some magical processes but quickly send them back before they got too bored. More wicked summoners would attempt to cool them to turn them into statues and sell them, but the threat of imminent death was normally enough to send magmen into panicked rampages, burning down the nearby vicinty in an attempt to escape.[3] Magmins assaulting the town of Triboar. Magmins were part of an entourage that helped to assault Triboar, during the shattering of the ordning.[5]",

        "description": "       Mammoths were enormously sized beasts, much larger than other elephants,[4][5] standing as tall as 15\u202ffeet (4.6\u202fmeters) at the shoulder and weighing in at 9 to 11\u202ftons (8,200 to 10,000\u202fkilograms).[3] Their tusks were extraordinarily long,[1] sometimes as long as the creature was tall,[3] and weighing on average 50% more than the tusks of a standard elephant.[6][4][5] All mammoths were covered in thick, woolly hair[4][5][1] that was brown and shaggy.[3] An adult mammoth could easily carry 3\u202ftons (2,700\u202fkilograms) of weight and could be compelled to carry even as much as 8\u202ftons (7,300\u202fkilograms)! A single beast was strong enough to drag 40\u202ftons (36,000\u202fkilograms).[3] Mammoths were surprisingly intelligent animals,[6][4][5][3] even exhibiting some higher-level emotions and customs, such as paying special respect to the bones of their dead, returning often to visit sites where fellow herd members have died, sometimes repeating such a pattern for years in the case of a mate, sibling, or calf.[3] Mammoths were usually calm creatures but became extremely aggressive if threatened,[6][3] far much more so than elephants.[4][5] They defended their young and had exceptional memories of previous aggressors, attacking creatures that had tried to harm them or their offspring in the past.[3] If given the option, mammoths preferred to fight with their herd and not in isolation, though a larger bull male might be an exception.[3] In general, they fought like elephants,[6] by charging, goring, stomping, and trampling.[1][3] If a mammoth caught a victim in its tusks, it often tossed that creature through the air.[3] The largest mammoths lived out in the open steppes, where they had little to fear, because of their massive size.[3] They organized into large herds,[4][5][3] led by the oldest female member, along with her sisters and daughters.[3] The male mammoths were the fighters who defended the herd.[3] They preferred to live in cold, subarctic climates,[4][5][1][3] such as the High Ice[9] and Sossal,[11] but could survive in many climates, even subtropical ones.[1] In fact, mammoths were common in the Shining Plains of the Vilhon Reach.[7][8] Mammoths, like other elephant species, were herbivores.[6][5][1] The ivory from mammoths was more expensive than that from other elephants.[6][4][5][12][13] It was possible to train a mammoth for use as a mount or pack animal, but this had to be done from a young age, because an adult animal would starve itself rather than submit to a trainer. Such training typically took at least six weeks.[3] During the time of the Empire of Netheril, a tribe of orcs known as the Icebeast orcs were skilled at taming and training such creatures as woolly mammoths and remorhaz.[9] In the same era, the Rengarth tribe relied heavily on the presence of mammoths in their land, using them both as a source of food and as beasts of burden. The Netherese believed that the affinity the Rengarth had for the mammoths was a form of magic (but in truth, the Rengarth hated all forms of magic).[14] In 1364 DR, Dwahvel Tiggerwillies claimed to have \"larger ears than a Sossalan mammoth\" in regards to her information-gathering skills.[11]",

Its long tail had a cluster of deadly spikes, which the creature could launch at its foes as weapons. It had incredibly tough claws and fangs.[1]    Manticores were true monsters. They were giant beasts with the bodies of lions, the wings of a dragon, the head of a man, and a tail that ended in a mass of deadly spikes.[1] The coloration of these various body parts was similar to that of their base creature.[5] The mouth of a manticore was full of rows and rows of razor-sharp teeth, similar to that of a great white shark. It used these teeth to feed upon any creature the manticore could catch, be it animal or human.[1] Manticores were known to be savage man-eaters and allies of evil creatures. Manticores were intelligent creatures and often worked beside other evil beings to bring strife and suffering to the world.[1] Some manticores had tail spikes that carried lethal or paralytic venom. Often, these manticores would have tails that were similar in appearance to that of a scorpion's stinger.[1] In the Year of the Groaning Cart, 1267 DR, manticores, along with harpies and perytons, destroyed the city of Lis in the Moonsea region in what was known as the Flying Plague.[6] Manticores were carnivorous creatures. Though they happy settled for the flesh of most any creature, they preferred the flesh of humans most of all.[7][5] Manticores were typically known to make their lairs underground or within caves, particularly ones that other races would consider to be very dismal.[5] These creatures could be found in almost any climate.[5] However, they far preferred to live in warm habitats.[3][5] In Northwest Faer\u00fbn, they could be found within the Delimbiyr Vale.[8] In West Faer\u00fbn, they could be found within the land of High Moor.[9] Manticore hide was valued among some creatures for its use in furniture, such as chairs.[10] A unique enchanted cloak, the Skin of the Manticore was created out of the beast's hide with the tail still attached. The enchantments placed on it allowed the wearer to control the venomous spiked tail of the cloak.[11]",

Mariliths eagerly joined melee combat if given the chance, though they carefully sized up a given situation first and plotted to use any terrain and vulnerabilities to their advantage. They could swiftly strike with each weapon in their six hands, typically longswords or scimitars. Their tails were capable of moving like a whip or constricting their foes.[3] Marilith wizards were truly terrifying beings. Not only did they not specialize in any one given school, but they had the rare power to cast spells with two of their arms while still fighting with two others. There were even rumors that some mariliths could cast more than one spell at once, but such claims were suspect.[10] A balor (left) and a marilith. Mariliths served as commanders and tactical experts for the Blood War, providing the stratagems to complement the malignant magnetism of the balors.[11] While the mariliths were typically the leaders of tanar'ri hordes, balors were often in charge of several hordes and commanded the masses in larger battles.[12] Mariliths believed the balors were in charge only because of their sheer power and were otherwise unneeded to conduct the Blood War, but they never acted on this belief in fear of that power.[11] Glabrezus were disliked by mariliths for their obnoxious insistence on using temptation and manipulation rather than outright warfare. Mariliths normally had to settle for merely undermining them as their balor superiors favored the glabrezus' sinister schemes.[11] Yuan-ti followers of Demogorgon and other demon princes displayed an affinity for the similarly serpentine mariliths. A good method of currying their service was the sacrifice of strong mortal warriors.[2] In 1373 DR, three mariliths known as the \"Triumvirate\" served under Kaanyr Vhok, the leader of the Scoured Legion of Hellgate Keep. One of those mariliths was Vhok's mother, Mulvassys the Sceptered.[13][14] In 1385 DR, the marilith Vhissilka, who served the balor Axithar, was trapped when the death of Mystra tore away a chunk of the Blood Rift. With the help of the cambion Kaanyr Vhok, Vhissilka was able to return to Axithar to wage war upon the House of the Triad.[15] In 1485\u20131486 DR, mariliths were among the demons that wandered the streets of Menzoberranzan and participated in the failed defense of Q'Xorlarrin against the dwarves. The great Marilith, for whom all mariliths were named, was among them. She allowed Malagdorl Del'Armgo to slay and banish her back to Abyss, but Gromph Baenre resummoned her days later, making a fool out of Malagdorl for claiming he'd defeated her. She was subsequently sent to fight against the dwarves at Q'Xorlarrin. She was confronted by Drizzt Do'Urden, who disabled her. Bruenor Battlehammer placed the final stroke that slew her and banished her.[16] Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

        "description": "      Typical medusae had scaly skins of either pale[5] or earthy color.[3] Their eyes glowed with an intense red color and, instead of hair, their heads were covered in a mass of 1\u2011foot-long (30\u2011centimeter) living venomous serpents. Despite those features, from large distances they could easily be mistaken by ordinary humans.[3][5] For that reason, it was common for medusae to hide their features behind hoods or veils.[3] People cursed into becoming medusae could belong to either sex[1] and both male and female medusae created by such curses were similar in form and capabilities.[10] An uncommon variant of medusa known as a greater medusa had the lower torso of a snake and its entire body covered by thin scales, with a total body length of 20\u202ffeet (6.1\u202fmeters). They produced considerably more potent poison, which rendered even their skins harmful to the touch. They also used their innate poison to coat their weapons and arrows.[5] In the Utter East, variants of medusae similar to greater medusae were sometimes referred to as \"gorgons\" (not to be confused with the iron-skinned bulls of the same name). While their look could petrify a living creature, it was reported that the effect was usually temporary. They lurked within the ruins of Phantom Pass and Old Stone Keep and in the Puzzle Palace.[11][note 1] An extremely rare variant of male medusa was known as a maedar, which lacked the head serpents and the petrifying gaze of regular medusae, but possessed great physical strength[12] and in some cases a poisonous weakening gaze.[2] Most medusae despised their own powers and viewed their abilities as a curse. They directed their frustration and anger outwards, seeking to petrify any living creature they encountered, and only used restraint when hunting prey for food or when searching for a mate.[9] A medusa with a petrified victim. The glowing red eyes of a medusa were feared for their petrifying power. Anyone within a range of 30\u202ffeet (9.1\u202fmeters) of a medusa who looked at its eyes could be transformed into lifeless stone within seconds, at the medusa's discretion. It was possible to resist that power through extraordinary physical resilience,[1][2][3] or by averting one's eyes from the medusa's.[1][3][12] The petrification was permanent, unless reversed with magic such as a greater restoration spell or similar.[1][12] A medusa's vision and petrifying gaze also reached into the Ethereal and the Astral Plane.[5] In the Border Ethereal, as a result of the plane's obscuring nature,[13] the creature's features could only be recognized at dangerously close distances: its bright red eyes could only be seen from 30\u202ffeet (9.1\u202fmeters) or less, while the serpents were only visible from a distance of less than 12\u202ffeet (3.7\u202fmeters). Although a medusa's gaze affected creatures in the Ethereal, its head snakes and physical attacks had no effect on ethereal targets.[14] A medusa was immune to the petrifying stare of other medusae,[5] but was susceptible to be turned into stone by its own gaze, for example when looking at its own reflection in a mirror or other reflective surface.[1][5] Even after death, a medusa's eyes retained their power for several days, becoming weaker as the corpse decayed.[5] A medusa's typical strategy was to lure potential victims within the 30\u2011foot (9.1\u2011meter) range of its gaze and then induce them into looking in its eyes. If the victims managed to avert their eyes in time, the medusa followed up with powerful attacks from its head serpents, whose venom was potent enough to severely poison or even kill a creature. If none of those strategies succeeded, medusae were also competent with a number of weapons, such as knives, short swords shortbows, and longbows.[1][5] Many medusae were considered skilled archers and some greater medusae were known to coat arrows with their poisonous saliva or blood.[2][5] Medusae prefered to live alone or in small groups, but they desired treasures and dominance over other humanoid societies. It was common for a group of medusae to seek to rule a rural community as a reclusive royal family, or for a lone medusa to become a crime lord or the leader of an assassin's guild. They were typically seen in the company of creatures who were immune to their gaze, such as grimlocks and gargoyles, though they were also known to gather humanoid servants.[2] Medusae and maedar formed monogamous relationships and usually mated for life,[12][9] forming a powerful emotional bond that bordered on obsession.[9] Medusae typically made their homes in dark caves or large abandoned structures. Their lairs progressively fell into a state of disrepair, riddled with shadowy overgrowth, hiding places, and obstacles, usually inhabited by nests of venomous serpents. While they enjoyed keeping the petrified statues of their victims as trophies or decoration for their lairs, some medusae also destroyed most of their victims' remains in order to make their lairs less immediately recognizable by wary adventurers.[1][12] It was common for medusae to associate with equally powerful or stronger creatures. In particular, medusae held yuan-ti in high regard, so small groups of medusae and maedar often allied with them to work together.[2] As a result of their ability to perceive and influence the Ethereal Plane, a few medusae made their home in the Border Ethereal.[15] The gaze from an ethereal medusa could just as easily petrify a victim in the Prime Material plane, which made them terrifying opponents.[14] Earth half-elemental medusae were also known to inhabit the caves of the Elemental Plane of Earth.[16][17] A few powerful medusae also made their home in Olympus and elsewhere in the first layer of Arborea,[18][19][20] as well as in Ysgard.[21] In the Lower planes, half-fiendish medusae could also be found in the Abyss and the Nine Hells.[22] Medusae respected the Titan Skoraeus Stonebones, but they did not worship him.[23] Rather, religious medusae worshiped the naga deity Shekinester, who they called Shekenster.[24] The yuan-ti god Sseth was known to favor medusae and maedar, often working through them.[25] Marlos Urnrayle, a male medusa. Medusae ate sparingly and had small appetites. Mated couples of medusae and maedar usually fed by the use of the maedar's ability to turn broken fragments of petrified victims back into flesh.[9] Among vegetable sources of food, medusae were particularly fond of shriekers and other fungi.[26] Medusae could reproduce by mating amongst themselves and with other humanoids. If mating with a human, a female medusa produced a clutch of between two and six eggs that always hatched into female medusae. The fate of a human after mating with a medusa was usually death by petrification.[5] If a medusa and a maedar mated, the eggs produced human offspring in 99% of the cases, in which case the babies were immediately petrified upon seeing their mother. In only 1% of the cases, a maedar was born.[5][12] Medusae laid their eggs within one month of mating, and the eggs had an incubation period of eight months. Young medusa hatchlings resembled human baby girls with green stubby tendrils growing from their heads, which came alive as serpents once they reached two years of age. Young medusae matured at the same rate as humans, and acquired the ability to petrify others upon reaching adolescence.[5] The blood of medusae had special properties that allowed it to reverse the process of petrification. In order for it to work, the blood needed to be applied to the petrified creature's mouth or lips by a skilled healer. It could only reverse the condition if the victim had been petrified within 24 hours.[2] Medusa blood could also be used to craft potions of human control and potions of mammal control. Older medusae were capable of brewing potions that could restore petrified creatures, which they traded amongst themselves and employed to restore petrified creatures by accident.[9] The venom from a medusa's snakes was renowned among assassins for its potency.[9] It was one of the required material components to scribe a scroll of protection from petrification. Each scroll required 1\u202ffluid scruple (1.2\u202fmilliliters) of venom, in addition to other ingredients.[27] A medusa's eyes could also be used as an ingredient for the scroll.[9] The head snakes themselves could be harvested to produce potions of reptile control. However, they were rarely harvested due to the horrible stench that emanated from them after death.[26] The stone from petrified corpses of medusae victims, when pulverized, could be used as a material component for spells that contacted denizens of other planes. This practice, however, tended to be restricted to evil priests,[26] but Zhentarim agents were sometimes known to collect them for use in their spells.[28] A medusa armed with a dagger. Some vain mortals could strike bargains with powerful fiends such as archdevils and demon lords, offering everything in exchange for the gift of long-lasting beauty, power, and the admiration of others. Upon the expiration of the splendorous years bargained for, the price was collected and the mortals were turned into medusae.[1] In the mid\u201214th century DR, members the Zhentarim were rumored to pursue an alliance with medusae and maedar of the Goblin Marches and the Stonelands, offering treasure in exchange for recruiting them as agents of the Black Network. They conducted negotiations while under the protection of an unknown spell that purportedly protected them from the medusae's gaze.[9] Around the same time, the inhabitants of Minroe developed a defense against a colony of medusae that lurked in a system of nearby caves, which were the source of prized pixie cap mushrooms that the inhabitants gathered and sold at high prices. The Minrovan farmers domesticated a variety of hedgehog shrieker that had developed a natural defense against medusae and only reacted to their presence. The citizens planted shrieker gardens around town to protect themselves from attacks, while gatherers carried them in carts when entering the caves.[26][28] A group of three medusae inhabited the Sargauth Level of Undermountain in the mid\u201214th century DR,[29] but they had been defeated by adventurers by the late 15th century.[30] By then, another group of two medusae inhabited the Caverns of Ooze, much deeper down the complex.[31] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

Also distinguishing them from humans were the gills slits along their necks, the slight webbing between their fingers, and their pupils exhibiting an ice blue or pale silver tone.[6] On average, mermen grew to be around 8\u202ffeet (2.4\u202fmeters) in length[2][6] and had broader shoulders, while mermaids grew only slightly shorter.[6] On average they weighed around 400\u202flb (180\u202fkg)[2] and it was unheard of for merfolk to become overweight, due to their active lifestyles, and possessed greater strength than their physiques would imply.[6] The coloration of their eyes, hair, and skin varied as much as those of humans, as did the coloration of their fins and scales \u2014 some colorations being more common in certain areas. Merfolk across Faer\u00fbn exhibited all the varied skin tones of the continet's humans. They tended towards pale pink or tan, though some around the Alamber Sea and Vilhon Reach had darker tones. The most common hair colors were light brown or blond, as these helped them to better blend in to their environment. The rarest of hair colors were blue and silver \u2014 those born with either were considered to have great destinies and so would be raised and watched over by their entire clan.[6] The coloration of merfolk fins and scales ranged from a deep kelly green to a brilliant silver, though some colorations outside of this could be found. Some Ser\u00f4sian merfolk exhibited brighter colors and even scales that were striped or speckled. While some merfolk in the Alamber Sea or Vilhon Reach had scales that ranged from copper to golden.[6] In terms of clothing, merfolk often adorned themselves with shells and coral.[2] And Ser\u00f4sian merfolk in particular had a widespread practice of tattooing across their culture.[7] Known to be playful creatures, merfolk would often prank adventurers they came across. Their levels of mischief could come across as cruel, but not overly malicious.[2] A mermaid warrior riding a shark and wielding a trident. Merfolk were generally known to wield crossbows, daggers, javelins, nets, and tridents. They also used grappling hooks when performing attacks on the surface dweller ships.[4] In \u22121533 DR, the merfolk of Thalorlyn declared themselves independent and established the First Kingdom of Hmur.[8] Two years later, Aryselmalyr quashed the rebellion at Thalorlyn and slaughtered some 30% of all merfolk in Ser\u00f4s.[8] In \u22121396 DR, the surviving merfolk of the Fourth Ser\u00f4s War formed the kingdom of Thalvan under King Darmox and the protection of the Coronal Vaeqiis of Aryselmalyr.[9] In the 6th century DR, the Ninth Ser\u00f4s War was fought between the merfolk realm of Hmurrath and the merrow Axe Kingdoms of Khuur and Nmalk in the undersea land of Ser\u00f4s.[10][11] The Battle of the Haunted Plains took place in 654 DR.[12] In 735 DR, the merfolk kingdom of Eadraal was founded.[13][14] Its capital city was Voalidru, just off the Hmur Plateau. Queen Selana was crowned the realm's first monarch.[14] In 1369 DR, the Twelfth Ser\u00f4s War occurred.[15] Merfolk generally lived in isolated settlements within coral reefs or cliffs that were honeycombed with numerous passages and rooms. Some lived within underwater cities of their own design, built from coral, rocks, and shells. Such communities tended to have netted pens where fish were kept like livestock.[4] They trained aquatic animals, such as giant seahorses, to serve as their guardians or steeds.[16] They were particularly known to train barracudas for this purpose, having three to eighteen protecting their communities.[4] Merfolk were an omnivorous people, both harvesting underwater plant life and hunting aquatic animals to eat. They were also known to herd and raise certain species of fish, much like surface dwellers did with livestock.[4] Merfolk could be found in a variety of aquatic regions, typically those with a temperate[2][4] or tropical climate. Many were only seen outside of their watery habitats to visit coastal places or bathe in the sun's rays.[4] Some were known to dwell in the Trackless Sea and Sea of Swords. In Waterdeep, merfolk dwelt in the harbor in their own city,[17] and the Merdock connected the sea to the watermen's guildhall so that merfolk could come through.[18] Merfolk also dwelt in the Sea of Fallen Stars, where the name Ser\u00f4s was used as a general term for all of the merfolk realms.[19] Myth Nantar (near the Whamite Isles) was inhabited by merfolk.[20] The falls of Rauthgor in the River Rauthenflow were also home to a colony of merfolk.[21] Merfolk generally knew how to speak Common and Aquan,[1][2] though some also knew how to speak the language of locathah.[4] Many merfolk worshiped the deity Eadro.[22] A mermaid holding a surface dweller. Merfolk were capable of interacting with surface folk, as they could survive outside of the water as amphibious creatures. However, they rarely traveled more than a few feet away from the water's edge.[2] In Ser\u00f4s, many merfolk were allied with neighboring selkies.[23]It was not unheard of for Sirines to mate with merfolk, producing children with joint characteristics of their parents, such as webbed fingers and scales.[24]",

        "description": " This is a\nGood Article!      Mimics occupied a volume of approximately 15\u202fcubic feet (0.42\u202fcubic meters). They could assume any shape, provided that they retained the same volume.[5] In order to most effectively lure adventurers, they most commonly took the shape of doors, chests, and other objects likely to be touched. Their skin texture and color could change to almost perfectly resemble wood, stone, metal, and other basic materials.[1][5] Though the natural state of a mimic's skin was a rough speckled grey similar to granite.[5][7] Mimics had no concerns beyond surviving and acquiring food. Although some intelligent varieties of mimics were capable of basic communication, they had no culture, no moral code, and no interest in religion. More aggressive mimics could not be reasoned with in any capacity.[5] Mimics were capable of altering the pigmentation and texture of their skins by pumping a brown pigmented fluid from internal muscular organs through surface capillary vessels. While the pigment granted them the appearance of wood, the capillaries themselves granted an appearance of wood grain. This fluid could be more readily seen in wounded mimics.[7] Their skins were covered with light-sensitive sensors that could detect heat out to a range of 90\u202ffeet (27\u202fmeters). These sensors were quickly overwhelmed when exposed to bright lights and could potentially even be rendered blind.[7] Mimics hunted by standing perfectly still until a creature came into contact with them.[6] They then attacked their victims by using a powerful adhesive secretion to trap them, while also employing their strong pseudopods to attack and further restrain the creatures' movements.[1][7] The adhesive, which was also a mimic's main means of locomotion, could be weakened by the application of alcohol over a few seconds, and was completely neutralized less than a minute after the mimic's death.[5] A mimic trapping an unwitting adventurer. Although mimics were usually solitary hunters, they often shared their vast territories with other species.[1] A meal of one or two humanoids could sustain a mimic for several weeks. They reproduced by splitting, growing to adulthood within a few years.[5] There were several subspecies of mimics, roughly divided into two groups: a larger, more aggressive, and less intelligent variant, known as killer mimics; and a smaller, more cunning variant known as common mimic that was capable of language and more refined combat tactics. Mimics of the second variety could disguise themselves as more ornate furnishings and were capable of negotiating and bargaining. They spoke their own language, as well as the languages of nearby communities.[5][6][7] Intelligent mimics were known to sometimes offer information or safe passage through their territory in exchange for food.[1] Rarely, mimics would establish large colonies, within which they could communicate telepathically with each other and with outsider mimics. Juvenile mimics born in a colony retained their telepathic abilities even away from their homes.[2] The skin of mimics could be used as an ingredient for making polymorph self potions.[7] Their adhesive secretions could also be sold to alchemists and their internal organs could be used in the production of perfumes or as food. Some cultures considered mimic organs tasty delicacies.[5] Most sages agreed that mimics were artificially created by wizards to serve as protectors against treasure hunters.[5][6] However, some speculated that they originated in the Far Realm.[3][8] Sometime in the 14th century DR, a mimic assumed the form of a statue in a busy market square in Waterdeep. It remained undetected for two years, feeding off stray animals and homeless humans and disposing of their bones on a nearby sewer access. The disappearances prompted an investigation that led to the death of two members of the City Watch who had prodded the statue.[7] Somewhat similar incident was described in The Adventures of Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei that took place sometime before 1372 DR. A naive and overly-ambitious group of young adventurers got lost in search of a dungeon to plunder somewhere in the wilderness and after camping overnight discovered a tower just outside of their tents. The youths rushed inside eager for the adventure, only to find nothing but a bone-chilling realization that they were inside a great hungry mimic.[9]",

        "description": "      An unarmored minotaur. Minotaurs were large, muscular humanoids. They had the head of a bull, upper torso, hands, and the body of a human,[20] and hooved feet. Their fur and wild hair typically ranged from brown to black.[4][1] The fur often covered forearms, chest, abdomen, and legs. Males were referred to as bulls and reached up to 9\u202ffeet (2.7\u202fmeters) in height, while females \u2013 cows, were similar in appearance, with broader hips, humanoid breasts, and reached only 7\u202ffeet (2.1\u202fmeters).[16] Minotaur bodies were of similar shape and build to that of an ogre. Their hands were huge and strong, ending in thick sharp yellow nails. Minotaurs were known to use claws in battle, but they were brittle and did not survive heavy use. Despite their heads being that of a bull, there were subtle differences in features between mundane beasts and minotaurs. Some were known to have cow-like tails; however, that trait was not common. Their snouts were thicker and longer than that of an animal, and bull-men had sharp carnivore teeth. Their canines were especially noticeable, and minotaurs never hesitated to bite their victims, prey, and opponents. Lastly, unlike bovines, minotaurs' eyes were positioned closer to the center of their faces, granting them good depth perception and another telltale evidence of their predatory nature.[16] The creatures' iconic feature \u2013 their horns \u2013 were very similar to normal bulls', slightly curving forward. Both males and females had similarly shaped huge horns. However, males' were longer and thicker on average. There were several horn coloring variations, and sometimes as many as three colors could be present. Minotaurs with dark fur often had dark yellow or brown horns.[16] The shortest horns were around 1\u202ffoot (0.3\u202fmeters) and could reach up to three times that length.[21] Minotaurs possessed almost uncanny tracking and navigational abilities and a superbly keen sense of smell.[16] They could easily visualize any path they needed to take to get close to the prey.[1] All minotaurs were immune to maze spells.[4] Minotaurs were always ravenously hungry, a trait that only fueled their aggression.[4] The youth showed little affection towards their mothers and fathers. Older females received no special treatment and were respected as long as they remained strong and physically superior to the youths. Overall, their society was patriarchal, and those females who were physically weaker than other members of the tribes were treated not much better than slaves. Younger minotaurs often stayed out of the way of older males just to avoid conflicts and brutal assertions of dominance. Adult minotaurs consumed copious amounts of alcohol and dueled over most things: treasures, females, power. Polygamy was common as bulls sought to father a great number of children. In some minotaur communities, males assembled harems of six-seven cows. In some fringe cases, infanticide was practiced in cases when a calf was born with physical deformities. Slavery was not unheard of. Some males kept weaker creatures as slaves while females were put in charge and allowed to take out their frustrations on their bulls' slaves. Despite that, minotaurs disliked torture.[16] Despite minotaurs' general brutality, they had the capability to be kind and empathetic.[20] Minotaurs were not highly intelligent but possessed instinctive cunning and were adept at ambush attacks.[4] They were particularly skilled at hunting their prey. In general, minotaurs preferred melee combat and utilized their horns for charge attacks.[3] Sound of rending flesh, breaking bones, and the scent of blood, sent minotaurs into a blood frenzy, leading to the monstrosities charging and rending any creature they saw.[1] They wore little to no armor, even when in combat.[22][4] Their favorite weapons were two-handed poleaxes, presumably acquired through trade. Other commonly used arms included crude clubs, two-handed hammers, flails, and occasionally, short and thick spears. Ranged weapons were virtually never used.[16] Closeup view of a minotaur bull's head. Minotaurs were eternally hungry man-eating carnivores. Despite their ravenousness, they could survive without food for several years.[4] Like humans, minotaurs procreated throughout the year. However, as a society, they were guided by the need to replenish their numbers rather than emotions. A typical cow produced one calf; twins were a rare possibility and were considered a religious blessing among minotaurs (sometimes an ill omen). Minotaurs matured much faster than humans: a two-year-old calf had fully formed horns and could kill an orc in combat, a five-year-old minotaur towered over other humanoids, and by their tenth year - minotaurs were considered adults. Minotaurs were capable of procreation as early as three years old in some cases. Culturally, birthing a strong male warrior was considered the height of aspirations for a minotaur cow, while a bull aspired to father as many calves as possible.[16] Some sages speculated that minotaurs lived 80 years on average, but determining their longevity was challenging as many of them led violent lives and perished long before their natural expiration. A thirty-year-old minotaur was often thought to be a steeled veteran.[16] The maximum lifespan was thought to be 200 years.[4] Minotaurs could prorate through mating among each other or with a human woman. Children born out of that union were always male minotaurs,[4] however, at least one human with minotaur heritage existed in the Realms.[23] A typical minotaur leader, also known as the elder,[4] was the biggest and strongest bull in the tribe, which did not necessarily mean the most intelligent leader. The tribe's king led his fellow bulls into raids.[16] Solitary minotaurs were a common occurrence,[1] however, a clan could have eight members.[4] Minotaur youth were taught to fight and master weapons at an early age. In the minotaur society, combat education was done by parents and fellow male tribe members. Even while playing, minotaur children spent most of their time wrestling and fighting each other. Male calves developed brutal and cruel rivalries amongst each other from earliest childhood, and these feuds were encouraged by the adults.[16] Minotaurs were proud of their horns and often spent their free time sharpening, cleaning, and polishing them with old rags or furs. In some minotaur societies, the color of their horns determined their status within the community and attractiveness. In minotaur tribes that preferred darker-colored horns, individuals often used oils and polishes to artificially darken them. Decorations were common as well. Brass and silver tacks and spikes were used to accentuate the horns' natural appeal. Repaired severed horns were common in tribes with talented crafters or skilled allies who knew how to work metals. After a duel, the winner customarily took the left horn of their opponent, often leaving the opponent maimed and badly injured. These horns were hollowed out and turned into wind musical instruments, and stronger individuals often owned several.[16] Apart from horn decorations, minotaurs rarely wore any other type of jewelry. The closest to what humans consider decorations among minotaurs were fanciful girdles or gauntlets. Sages speculated that minotaurs were known to easily adapt traditions and norms from other races and societies in lieu of their own culture. Of course, those cultural norms that were aimed at aggression and intimidation were highly preferred and emulated.[16] When interacting with other races, minotaurs got along well with ogres. They respected giants and trolls for their strength. Smaller humanoids, such as humans, elves, dwarves, and others, were considered beneath minotaurs in all senses of the word. Bulls could not, or didn't care enough to distinguish one humanoid from another.[16] Gnolls and minotaurs hated each other and immediately attacked each other on sight.[4] Many minotaurs worshiped the demon lord Baphomet[24] and kept themselves, and their society, secluded. Most were inclined to evil and chaotic acts and did not work well in groups, packs, or even parties due to their solitary hunter-like nature.[2] Levels of reverence and even religious traditions varied greatly among different minotaur communities.[16] Priests decorated their horns with carved pictograms. The images were filled with blood to darken the designs, and finally, the horns were stained with yellowing agents. Instead of priestly garb, minotaur priests decorated their bodies with soil, dirt, plant matter, and blood spilled in battle. Gnoll blood was the preferred decoration for a reason known to none but priests themselves. The worship was centered on sacrificial ceremonies that took place in the heart of labyrinthine minotaur homes, adorned with bones of precious victims. The most common sacrifice was a human. Minotaur clerics received little respect apart from the respect earned through physical strength. However, horns collected from defeated bull priests were considered extremely valuable.[16] Death was not feared in minotaur society. On the contrary, death was considered to be a holy event. Minotaurs thought good death to be quick, clean, and in a rush of battle. Honor kills were a staple of minotaurs' cultural and religious creed.[16] Arcane spellcasting was extremely rare among minotaurs as most lacked the curiosity to pursue the Art. Minotaurs could be easily fooled by wizardly spells. However, if the duping was discovered, the magic and its caster were treated with extreme prejudice.[16] Divine magics granted to clerics were seldom of healing nature, instead, being battle-focused. Magics such as bull's strength were the most used.[16] Magic items held little value for most minotaurs and were traded away for other valuables or alcohol most of the time.[16] Minotaur language was very similar to the Ogre language, allowing those who were proficient in one tongue quickly pick up the intricacies of the other. One unique part of the Minotaur language was a number of vocalizations only known and comprehendible by their own kin, reminiscent of grunts and sounds emitted by mundane cattle bulls, by some accounts.[16] A powerful minotaur gladiator from Thay. Minotaurs were most likely found in their underground labyrinthine homes, dungeons,[2][4][5] or thickest of forests.[16] Sometimes evil wizards were known to place a clan of minotaurs inside a labyrinth and feeding them interlopers and adventurers.[4] There, minotaurs' innate sense of direction prevented them from getting lost.[3] They often made their money by plundering and raiding passers by, but also sought employment as mercenaries, fighters and servants. Minotaurs were also often kept as slaves by Underdark inhabitants, such as mind flayers and drow.[18][17] A reasonably sized population could be found in found within the Underdark in an area known as the Labyrinth, and an occasionally \u2013 in the underground city of Skullport in Undermountain, as of the late 14th century DR.[7][25][8] Nelanther Isles was known for a population of sea-faring pirate minotaurs as of the late 15th century DR.[14] Mountains of the Moonsea were home to sporadic bands of minotaurs,[13] as well as deserts of Raurin.[26] The city of Kushk in the Hordelands was occupied by a wide variety of monster races. One of the city's wards - aptly named Minotaur City, was a district of narrow maze-like alleys and home of the city's minotaur population.[10] Minotaurs also were among more exotic inhabitants of Huzuz in Zakhara.[12] The caves of Daerndar, in the Grand Duchy of Shantal of the Border Kingdoms, were affected by storms of wild magics and spellstorms. Among creatures spirited into the caverns was a significant number of minotaurs.[9] Another population of minotaurs lived in peace with humans in the Chultan city of Omu until the city was enslaved by lich Acererak long before the 13th century DR.[11] Outside of Toril, minotaurs inhabited numerous crystal spheres, most notably, on the world of Krynn,[27] and could be found in the Domains of Dread.[28] In the planes, numerous minotaur tribes roamed the Endless Maze in the Abyss \u2013 the layer where the minotaur deity Baphomet dwelt.[29] In the ancient Empire of Netheril, minotaur tail hairs were used to make special braided brushes. These items were used in arcane magic rituals.[30] Oil of minotaur musk was a rare commodity imported into Waterdeep and often imitated and faked by some industrious individuals.[31] Minotaur parts were used in creation of certain potions and as material components for spells that dealt with physical strength, location, and misdirection,[4] one notable use being a minotaur's heart used in creation and animation of fearsome minogon constructs.[32] Powdered horn of a minotaur was the main component in oil of impact.[33] The same material was the material component needed to cast the Old Empires spell \u2013 Horns of Hathor.[34] Zegdar of the Emberhorn tribe. The origin of the minotaur species was unknown. However, some speculated that Geryon molded the first bull-men out of ogres. This claim was quite dubious as minotaurs never uttered Geryon's name and only swore or praised Baphomet.[16] Another theory was that the first especially devote cultists of Baphomet the Horned King were transformed into minotaurs as this transformation was considered the highest honor in the Demon Lord's church.[35][1] Yet another myth talked about the Lady of Pain, the mysterious power that ruled over Sigil. These tales claimed that the first minotaurs were created by her to guard the Lady's many magical planar maze prisons.[21] Yet one more legend claimed that minotaurs were created by some curse placed on a human fighter who wanted to be \"as strong as a bull\" for \"crimes against the natural order.\" The same school of thought mistakingly believed that minotaurs were exclusively male.[4] Among planar creatures and inhabitants of Sigil, a common legend stated that bulezau were created by Baphomet through crossbreeding minotaurs and tanar'ri. However, the legend remained unconfirmed.[36] In the \u221210000 DR, minotaurs were forced to flee Narathmault along with their drow masters, traveling to the underground caverns of Plateau of Thay.[37] Apart from that, not much was known of Minotaur history, but it was said that the Labyrinth was once an empire, rather than the uncivilized lands it was known as.[18][38] In the Year of Lurking Death, 1322 DR, a band of roving minotaurs ravaged a small town of the Dead Tree Hollow in the Vast. One of the survivors of the attack was a five-year-old Tordon Sureblade, who escaped to the city of Ravens Bluff with his father. Tordon eventually became the Lord Magistrate of Ravens Bluff.[39] In the 14th century DR, peaceful minotaurs were known to frequent Beruintar\u0092's Hone Warmer inn in Waymoot[40] and be among members of the Fall of Stars adventurers' guild of the Dalelands.[41] In the Year of the Scarlet Witch, 1491 DR, the Emberhorn minotaur tribe under the leadership of Zegdar, joined forces with the Cult of the Eternal Flame. The tribe's leader was blessed by his deity Imix and led the tribe down a destructive path. The Emberhorns often beheaded their opponents and roasted the heads in hot coals in praise of the All-Consuming Fire.[42] Redtip, ring fighter and a pirate from the Nelanther Isles.",

Compared to donkeys, they were faster and more intelligent.[2] However, they were an infertile species.[2][5] AD 5 Things You Should Never Do With Your Money, According to Experts By The Penny Hoarder In the late-15th century DR, mules were one of many beasts of burden that could be found in the Outer City district of Baldur's Gate, as such animals were outlawed from entering the Lower and Upper City districts.[6] At that time in the history of Baldur's Gate, the Flaming Fist mercenary company paid some stables in the Outer City to maintain a reserve group of them.[7] And whenever merchants traveling the Coast Way or Trade Way came to the city, they would leave their mules in either the Outer City or Blackgate.[8] Places in the Realms where one could find mules being bred or sold included the following: These creatures were often herded among other grazing beasts in order to protect them from wild predators, such as coyotes or wild dogs.[13] Mules were well accustomed to eating grass, requiring no separate fodder.[14] Mules were a common beast of burden among both gold dwarves and shield dwarves.[15] The former typically bred their mules from Lhesperan or Meth horses.[16] In Kh\u00f4ltar, mules were used to drive pumps that carried water from the small city's reservoir and into the cisterns of buildings.[17] Other places in Faer\u00fbn were mules were common beasts of burden included Turmish[18] and Waterdeep.[19] Beyond being beasts of burden, mule flesh was favored by halfling cooks.[5]",

        "description": "   Mummies were undead creatures created from a preserved mummified corpse animated by the dark gods of the desert.[3]    The most common mummy appeared as a humanoid creature, wrapped in old strips of linen, damaged by rot and age. However different types of mummified creatures existed. They stood somewhere between 5\u202ffeet (1.5\u202fmeters) and 7\u202ffeet (2.1\u202fmeters) tall.[4] Many mummies carried a distinct aroma of the ingredients used in their creation. Such smells were emitted by cinnamon, ginger, saltpeter, roses, myrrh, frankincense, lye, and pomegranate. While others carried less pleasant smells of upturned earth, decay, and vegetable rot. And rarely, mummies could smell of bread or yeast, wine, vinegar, and even roasted meats.[6] A centaur mummy. Mummies caused fear in the living on sight, and any creature they touched was affected by a rotting curse called mummy rot.[3] The rot, if left uncured, could kill its host within 1-6 months. With each passing month, the victim suffered from the disease, their skin rotted more and more, and the natural healing rate significantly slowed down. This affliction could be alleviate via the cure disease[4] or break enchantment spells[3], while cure wounds was completely useless. When a creature died from the mummy rot, the disease destroyed the corpse within twelve seconds, leaving extremely little time to return them to life by magical means. A fully rotted corpse could not be resurrected by the raise dead spell.[4] Among other diseases that were carried by various mummified creatures were deadeye, heartsting, deathbite, and palsy.[6] All mummies spread terror, forcing even the bravest creatures to flee in terror[18] or be paralyzed by the looming dread.[4] These undead creatures could only be harmed by magical or enchanted weapons, and even these tools were only partially effective. Like many other undead, mummies were immune to spells and effects such as sleep, charm, hold,[4] poison, and paralysis,[5] while cold was completely useless when wielded against them. Fire, both magical and mundane, as well as holy water, posed significant danger to mummies.[4] A mummy could be returned to life by a cleric with the use of the resurrection spell. However, it depended on the priest's abilities and the mummy's age. Remove curse did not affect them, while spells such as wish could return mummies to life.[4] Mummies were the undead guardians of tombs and vaults of honored dead (such as kings or nobility of the ancient world). They patrolled their homes with dedication, remaining alert for signs of tomb robbers or others who would defile their assigned lair.[3] In their state of undead existence, mummies felt hatred to all living things, attacking every creature in their way indiscriminately.[4] Mummies were granted great physical strength, and their scabrous touch carried a virulent curse that acted as a disease, known as mummy rot.[3] Mummified creatures used their natural weapons with the unnatural undead strength to clobber, pummel, claw, or bite their opponents. However, more exotic mummified creatures retained some of the fearsome abilities they had in life.[6] Fresh unused linen mummy wrappings. Most mummies were not created by magical means and were simply embalmed nobles, heroes, and other important individuals.[4] In some cases, mummification and being turned into undead guardians was reserved for criminals or transgressors who wronged a powerful leader or priest.[1] After being interred, these mummified creatures, were known to spontaneously rise from tombs when their final resting places were disturbed. The forces that aided in the creation of these creatures could be unspeakable dark magics or greed of the interred person in life, unwilling to suffer grave robbers in death. This powerful feeling of greed could tap into the energies of the Positive Energy plane, transforming them into the walking dreadful undead beings.[4] Due to their connection to the Positive Energy plane, mummies existed simultaneously on both Prime Material and Positive Energy planes.[4] Like other undead, mummies were not natural creatures, did not need eat nor drink, and had no predators and natural enemies.[4][1] A mummy in the Tombs of Dayan raising to stop the intruders. Most commonly, mummies could be found in dry desert locations on Toril. Sealed inside ancient tombs, catacombs, and burial chambers, and pyramids' cores. Most tombs that held mummified individuals were interred within complex crypts with traps and numerous rooms filled with the treasures, relics, and favorite items they possessed in life. These possessions often included pets, foods, aromatic oils. Tombs that were evil creatures' final resting place often included the mummies' slaves and family members killed and interred with their cruel masters.[4] Circa 1340 DR, mummies could be encountered in the swamps outside the town of Phlan in the Moonsea region.[7] Shambling and moldering mummies were encountered in Gauntlgrym circa 1479 DR.[8] Wandering undead, including mummies, were known to plague Red Cliffs in the High Moor, and especially mummies created for bog burials could be encountered in the region's peat bogs.[9] In Zakhara, mummies could be found in the catacombs under ruined Moradask, the city of Sun.[10] In the Old Empires, mummies were a common undead occurrence in Mulhorand due to their mummification burial customs. Wandering mummy creatures could be encountered in the Great Vale and in civilized areas of the land at night and in the wastes.[11] Beyond the Prime Material plane, mummies could be found in the Domains of Dread.[12] The spell mummy creation animated a corpse into a mummy, but only for a short period of time.[27][28] The Baneite spell undeath after death allowed the worshipers of the deity to return to unlife after death in forms of several types of undead, including mummies.[29] Traditional mummy was created via a long and arduous process of mummifying a body. The corpse that was to become a mummy was first soaked in a preservative substance, such as a carbonate of soda. The soaking was done over the course of several weeks. Then the body was covered with aromatics, such as spices and raisins. The body's hearts, brains, and liver were often removed and preserved in separate jars and stored not far from the mummified body within the tomb. The body was thoroughly preserved wrapped in linen cloth strips that sometimes held gemstones affixed between the sheets.[4] Some mummies, often monstrous mummies' linens were dyed and soaked in additional preserving salves and tinctures of herbal nature.[6] When mummies were created to serve as eternal guards via necromantic magics, the mummy wrappings were inscribed with magical symbols, and the ritual culminated in a dark magic incantation that created the undead creature. The sentry mummy became animated when specific conditions indicated in its creation were met. These conditions typically were trespassing in the mummy's tomb, theft, or offenses against the mummy's loved ones.[1] The legendary ancient guardian living mummy of Cursrah. Raised animal mummies were known to serve as undead minions to more powerful beings, mummies, or other dangerous forms of intelligent undead, while monster mummies often were created to specifically serve as eternal guardians.[6] Yuan-ti communities created malison mummies to serve as protectors often stationed within the snake cities, hideouts,[30] and temples of Zehir.[31] Aspects of the kobold deity Kurtulmak were known to use mummies as guardians.[32] The avatar of Jergal, the Lord of the End of Everything, took on the shape of a desiccated and mummified creature of some unknown ancient alien race.[33] Mummy dust was a valued spell component used to create items enchanted with rot and disease,[4] such as breath of life[34] or undead summoning,[35] and mummy bone was one of known material component used in certain spells,[36] such as scare.[37] A coloring powdered pigment from the Old Empires, known as \"mummy brown,\" was originally created out of crushed and milled mummy remains.[36] Mulhorandi mummy's tea were foul-smelling potions brewed using used mummy wrappings. These concoctions were used to alleviate various ailments, similarly to the effects of cure blindness or deafness and cure disease spells.[38] Dust of the mummy was a powdered poison, sometimes used in trap making. The poison was a byproduct of the embalming process, distilled out of organs removed during the mummification. When inhaled, the dust of the mummy caused an infection of mummy rot disease. The effects of the poison could be elicited with a dose of mummy rot antidote.[39] Mummy wrappings were a rare commodity, valued at 40 gold coins.[40] A risen mummy and its canopic jars. In 1369 DR, an ancient magic-wielding mummy that dated back to \u22126048 DR was raised when its ancient home city of Cursrah was unearthed. The mummy was tasked with protecting the buried city's greatest treasures. It was later revealed that the mummified creature was ruled by the life energy of Tafir of the ancient Cursrah, while the body of Amenstar was turned into a unique living mummy, awake, intelligent, and alert. Subsequently, the powerful creature was turned into dust and rags.[41] Circa 1375 DR, mummies, along with other undead, were in service of a vampire, Xedac of the Twisted Rune, who was sent into Undermountain to steal an enchanted runestone created by Halaster Blackcloak.[42]",

Among the most hideous of demonic powers, their bodies were most generously described as corpulent, combining the most abysmal features of a boar and ape into a bipedal monstrosity. They had small, feathered wings, greatly undersized compared to their rotund figures, that despite their flimsy appearance, enabled nalfeshnees to fly.[3] Nalfeshnees did not so much walk as waddle, when they were not simply flying.[2][3] Their glowing red eyes looked hungrily at most mortals they came across.[4] Behind their swinish exterior, both in appearance and behavior, nalfeshnees possessed a dangerous intellect.[1] Other beings were placed within three categories by nalfeshnees: \"fit to eat\", \"fit to use\", and \"fit to serve\". Creatures a nalfeshnee would consume included animals, lesser demons, and most humanoid races. They did not conduct negotiations with these beings, the same as most people would not converse with their food. Among a nalfeshnee's preferred foods were halflings and terrified beings.[2] The second group consisted of beings that had more worth outside a nalfeshnee's stomach than within it. Powerful humanoids, certain demons, gnomes, immortals, insects (including arachnids), and elemental creatures were in this category. Some entities within this category were of no use to a nalfeshnee, they were here because they were simply inedible.[2] Beings worthy of a nalfeshnee's servitude would have to be far greater than the nalfeshnee itself, a position reserved for demon lords, balors, primordials, and powerful elementals. The true spinelessness of a nalfeshnee was only revealed when in contact with one of these entities. Normally nalfeshnees employed cutlery, regardless of condition, in an attempt to appear dignified and renounced combat as being underneath them. In the presence of a more powerful being, this facade melted away into a whinging, sycophantic wretch that bowed and scraped to its masters without shame.[2] Although their intellects often rivaled those of balors, causing them to view themselves as superior, nalfeshnees obeyed them in recognition of their greater strength. When their masters were not present, nalfeshnees would not hesitate to secretly foil their plans or embarrass them. Nalfeshnees carried no great regard for the Blood War and would sabotage their balor masters even if it worsened the side of demons overall.[4] With claws and teeth, nalfeshnees were capable of brutality in the heat of battle. Like other tanar'ri, they could summon fellow tanar'ri to aid them when needed. These could be demons as powerful as glabrezus, hezrous, or even another nalfeshnee if need be. Despite their bloated bodies, they could easily, if clumsily, navigate the battlefield with their wings, if not their teleportation powers. Their truesight pierced illusions or other means of deception. A small array of spells were in their possession. Another ability most commonly used by nalfeshnees was their specialized ability to smite those around them with unholy light. Those struck by this light were dazed, surrounded by visions of their worst fears.[3] A fearsome nalfeshnee in battle. Although they put on airs of being above brawling, nalfeshnees were demons with a near irresistible bloodlust. When they deemed it acceptable they would engage in battle, smiting their foes with their nightmarish nimbus ability before ruthlessly savaging them while they were dazed. While physically dangerous they were more likely to be found on the battlefield soaring above the masses to target more easily defeated foes. When in the middle of combat they used their telepathic abilities to bark orders at their inferiors, all the while terrifying their enemies.[1] Nalfeshnees were best known for their roles as the judges of the Abyss, processing damned souls from the Mountain of Woe them as appropriate, a task they loved to perform.[3][7] From atop their flaming thrones, they were the ones responsible for turning the newly deceased of the Abyss into manes, or other lesser demons depending on whether food, slaves, or slave food was most needed.[7] The rulers of the plane, aptly titled the Lords of Woe, claimed knowledge over the quality of the petitioners brought before them and the ability to properly assess the best demon they would make. Such claims were likely complete fabrications, as despite having guidelines, nalfeshnees were ultimately beings of chaos which would whimsically promote those before them into whatever form they desired.[7] Although lesser demons were more common transformations, nalfeshnees could turn petitioners into demons such as chasme immediately.[8] Gabberslug, a nalfeshnee judge in Sigil's Court of Woe. The intended procedures for the promotion of petitioners typically had manes made from the spirits of those without sufficient malevolence and malleability and dretches made from those that did. Rutterkin were made from the especially prideful so as to teach them humility through humiliation. Nalfeshnees did not normally function as commanders but were said to decide the makeup of Abyssal armies, with some claims even being that they could promote and demote demonic generals, thus altering the path of the Blood War.[7] Nalfeshnees, despite their love of food, possessed reasonable self-control. They often obtained food from the Prime Material Plane and stored it within their pantries rather than simply eating it immediately. This food was later consumed in elaborate feasts with other nalfeshnee.[1] When nalfeshnees trained to become wizards, they typically focused their studies on necromancy so as to create undead minions to protect their strongholds.[9] The process by which nalfeshnees created demons was a horrific one that befitted their voracious nature. Nalfeshnees devoured not only flesh, but negative emotions such as misery, fear and rage out of those they saw. Feelings like these were consumed in tandem with life force through their hungry eyes, leaving the husks of the former victims left full of empty thoughts. Victims that weren't killed by the process were left in a dazed state for potentially weeks, incapable of fighting, sleeping or even thinking properly. Afterwards, the drained shells were transformed into tanar'ri in torturous ceremonies.[4][10] A nalfeshnee in graceful flight. The fact that soul larva typically arrived at the Woeful Escarand was not a coincidence. The demons of the Abyss had intentionally subverted the system millennia ago so that such souls could be judged and promoted at the discretion of the Lords of Woe.[11] The lich Acererak trapped a nalfeshnee in a black obelisk outside his Tomb of the Nine Gods, as a guard against those would topple the obelisk.[12] There was a statue of a nalfeshnee on the Dungeon Level of Undermountain.[13] The archmage Arcturia kept a nalfeshnee in a nalfeshnee shaped pedestal, as a guard for her phylactery in the layer of Arcturiadoom in Undermountain.[14] A nalfeshnee skull, decorated.

        "description": "   Night hags were horrendously hideous beings, unrivaled in their repulsiveness even when compared to most other hags and much more so when compared to ordinary crones. To describe them as merely ugly was an immeasurable understatement and comparing them to human women at all could be seen as an affront to the gender.[8] Whether sickly and stout, of average build, or gaunt and bony, night hags were most visually similar to small female trolls, complete with a strange strength hidden behind their decrepit frames[8][11] and a deadly set of long, night-black nails.[5] Their gait was slow and their bodies ungainly despite their similarity in height and weight to human females, a problem caused by the uncanny ways their joints moved.[3][8] Their sickening skin tone made their entire forms seem awfully bruised, with a blue-violet hue that could be fairly light or so dark they seemed completely black. They self-augmented their flesh with tattoo-like scars to enhance their eeriness, although it was often already marred with grotesque warts, open sores, and diseased blisters brought on by planar plagues.[3][8] Like an unkempt coif, pitch-black hair often hid most of a night hag's horrid visage and unbearable body, although not without compensating for the lost terror that came from doing so. Bones, fingers and other heinous accessories were typically woven into their manes in ways the night hag in question found especially bloodcurdling[8] and thin, curved horns made their way through the ebony locks.[11] Behind the veil of hair laid a pair of light, hellish eyes with pinprick pupils radiating a rage-filled red and a jaw that reached out like a fearsome hook from underneath their sharply pointed noses.[8][12] Rows of jagged, yellow fangs coated in foul saliva rocked unfirmly in their gums and awkwardly jutted out from their festering, wizened lips.[3][8][12][13] Both diabolical and destructive, night hags combined the most despicable traits from fiends throughout the lower planes with the insidious nature of their sinister sisterhood. From their hag side they adopted the desire to sow misery and malcontent in the hearts of mortals everywhere, particularly through the method of bargaining. Like devils, they harbored an indomitable megalomania and unbreakable ambition, crossed with the overpowering need for carnage more typically found in demons.[8][11] However, the common thread running through their various hateful heritages was the utter glee with which they approached the act of corruption. Night hags were perversely subversive and took delight in turning virtues into vices, either by amplifying positive traits until they became unhealthy or by simply turning ideals into their diametric opposites. Corrupting mortals was both business and pleasure for them as doing so was not only innately satisfying but, like demons and devils, also granted them the victim's soul upon death which they could use as a commodity later on.[1][11] No bond was too sacred, tactic too low, or act too mercilessly for the soul-hungry merchants of Hades.[8][11][13] Tempering a night hag's compulsion to inflict suffering was their love of learning and need to maintain their livelihoods. They were gripped by the desire to acquire new knowledge and possessed perfect memories, making them highly informative, if incredibly dangerous, sources of lost secrets, ancient wisdom and forbidden lore.[12][13] Despite not caring about the opinions of others regarding their activities, night hags typically kept their promises once made since stains on their reputations, such as being backstabbers or having poor wares, would negatively impact their business.[14][12] The safest ways to deal with night hags often included bribing them with information and offers of arcane power, as they prized them about as much as souls.[12][13] A night hag extracting pain in liquid form. At the same time, trying to bargain with night hags was still an unthinkably terrible idea as they were vindictive manipulators that would track down and turn their weaker customers into larvae after concluding business. An even worse idea would be to attempt to trick them since they were immortal, petty, and potentially the most stubborn residents of the Gray Wastes, always taking revenge no matter how slight the slight. As expert con merchants themselves they were incredibly difficult to fool, but after discovering they were deceived could waste years, potentially forever, crafting evermore intricate schemes to outsmart their target. Insults and altruistic acts were both remembered but they were quicker to repay the former as opposed to the latter.[12][13] Night hags were psychopaths and classified all other beings in terms of usefulness: the weak were branded as food or slaves, with slave often being a temporary position until the subject was turned into food, and the strong served as targets for subtle extortion until they were weak enough to be classified as food or slaves.[8] They retained no particular loyalty or hatred for other night hags and covens were only formed occasionally when one powerful night hag dominated her sisters, although such indifference was sometimes attributed to the Gray Wastes.[8][12][13] Material hags were sometimes contended with but always haughtily looked down on, subjugated either as individuals or in preestablished covens and never joined as equals.[8] Perhaps the only positive trait of the night hags was their lack of bias on the basis of race or class. They were thought to view the multiverse as a constant power struggle where the roles of master and servant were in a state of constant flux. It was due to this view that they never made permanent alliances, possibly the one thing preventing them from further controlling the Lower Planes. Racial privilege was viewed as a worthless concept and regardless of where one came from or what they were, they could expect fair treatment from night hags, the same competitive, predatory malice they displayed to everyone else.[8][12][13] Night hags had an array of magical powers at their disposal, including the ability to cast ray of enfeeblement, sleep and magic missile as spell-like abilities. They could magically discern the alignment of most beings detect magic and polymorph in order to take on the guise of a female member of other races, typically in the form of a crone.[1][2][3] Like most hags, the frail, elderly exterior of night hags belied their raw, physical strength, which wasn't diminished even when they took on other forms.[1] Their hideous maws could transmit a disease called demon fever via bite and when not polymorphed they retained their wicked sharp claws.[3] Night hags could only be properly harmed by weapons that had undergone powerful enchantment or that had been constructed from silver or cold iron. Heat and cold barely phased them, magic typically had little effect, and they were entirely immune to magic designed to charm, frighten or put them to sleep.[12][1] Night hags normally kept two powerful magic items with them at all time, the first of which was a special periapt known as a heartstone. Also called 'charms of blackness', heartstones were lustrous and magically potent black jewels worn as amulets by night hags. When in their possession, they allowed night hags to activate their ability to become ethereal and to cure any disease simply by touching it, a tool of incredible importance for any resident of the plague-ridden plane of Oinos. They were, particularly when used by good-aligned beings, substantially less useful out of a night hag's hands, shattering after ten uses and incapable of granting non-night hags the ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane. To craft a new heartstone required a month's worth of work and the sacrifice of several larvae in the process, making the retrieval of a lost heartstone of paramount importance to them.[1][13] Night hags could use their spectral state to haunt the dreams of those on the Material Plane. They would ride on a victim's back, filling their sleeping minds with mind-bending visions, crippling anxieties and dread-inducing nightmares until the break of dawn. Through this method, night hags could gradually wear down their prey both physically and mentally, sapping their vitality while driving them mad in the hopes that they would grow even more depraved.[1][8][13] Visits from a night hag in such a fashion only had to last an hour before all benefits of a night's rest was lost and powerful restoration magic was normally required to help victims recover. If unimpeded in their mental invasions, night hags would continue straddling their marks until they died in their sleep. It was at this point that a night hag's other powerful item, her soul bag, came into use. Crafted over the course of a week from the flesh of a sacrificed humanoid, soul bags were black sacks that could hold a single soul that had been killed by a night hag's dream haunting ability, although unlike heartstones only the specific creator could use them.[1] Night hags could immediately determine soul larva quality, which souls became larvae upon death and possibly even the specific, malicious acts necessary for a wicked mortal to become a soul larvae.[8][12] With this knowledge, night hags caught the larval life essence of those they had corrupted in their soul bags before dragging them down into Hades where they would become an especially powerful kind of soul larva. The entire process of dream haunting had several flaws interwoven throughout the various stages, such as the fact that it only worked on sufficiently selfish beings.[13][8] The sleep-related powers of night hags had reportedly different levels of effectiveness on those that were not evil, or at the very least chaotic, such as their sleep spell-like ability not functioning or the bag being unable to entrap the soul. Other weaknesses included the use of truesight to detect their presence, protection from evil and good and magic circle to block a night hag's intrusions, or techniques that affected the ethereal in order to interrupt the process.[1][8] A night hag wielding an axe. Cruel and devious in the extreme, night hags had access to unique and deadly magical items, arrays of minions and a willingness to sacrifice all of them to protect herself if need be.[8][11] When they believed themselves to have reasonable chances of success they would quickly murder any goodly being they came across, favoring the use of sleep to render their prey unconscious before cheerfully choking them to death,[3][13] although some reports claimed they could literally enter and tear apart their target's mind from the inside. Allies typically prevented any other parties from interfering while they killed. However, night hags were rarely direct in their tactics, and often adopted other forms to spy on trespassers or lure them in before rendering them all unconscious.[2] It was necessary to take all precautions possible when confronting a night hag as they would do the same against any threats to themselves, watching and slowly murdering enemies from the ethereal plane if able to move there unseen. Multiple hostages were often kept on the ethereal plane and would be ruthlessly murdered and made examples of in order to ward off hunters that cared about them. They might also kidnap spellcasters, those most likely to be nuisances but incapable of withstanding direct assault, taking them to the ethereal plane by ambushing and grabbing them, necessitating spells like grease or blur to escape their grasp.[8] It was no surprise that they preferred the use of traps and guardians that made use of poisons and diseases given their heartstone's ability to cure them whenever needed and they often employed lower-planar diseases. Breaking a night hag's heartstone was one of the best tactics when fighting them since it weakened them and prevented them from moving to other planes without assistance. Failing that, spells such as forcecage were tremendously useful in limiting their movements and tactical options while etherealness allowed them to be fought on equal terms.[8] Despite being among the greatest economic powers of the Lower Planes and a crucial link in the ecology of many creatures that lived there, night hags were also among the most quickly dismissed of its denizens.[12] They were terrifying creatures to those of the Prime Material Plane, but they were relatively puny by extraplanar standards, easily beaten by a few mezzoloths.[14] They were not to be mistaken as flimsy or frail, as any being capable of winning respect from balors and pit fiends was likely incredibly dangerous,[12] but their lack of strength compared to other lower-planar races often raised questions of why other forces, good or evil, hadn't driven them out of Hades and taken control for themselves. This was often written off as a result of the Gray Wastes stealing the thirst for conquest from would-be invaders but such propositions were entirely false.[14] Night hags were the nightmare queens of Hades,[8] but not due to overwhelming power and threats or far-reaching and complex plotting. Instead, night hags used a subtler and simpler method, manipulating various malevolent factions against each other using soul larvae as their means of control.[12][14] The Oinoloth, leader of the yugoloths, might have ruled the Gray Wastes in name but functionally it was the night hags that actually controlled it, if only because the majority of the yugoloths migrated to Gehenna and the Oinoloth spent much of their time dealing with the intrigues of their own kind.[13][12][15] As independent sellers, night hags could determine their own prices, trading in gold, information, favors, magic items, evil souls and whatever else they desired. Through this capitalistic puppeteering, night hags acquired new ways to extort others, gained secrets to connivingly trade between opposing forces and otherwise improve their political standing.[14] In exchange for larvae, powerful fiends could be persuaded to avoid trying to conquer Hades while liches might be asked to destroy certain parties that refused to participate in the larva trade.[4] Larvae trading was the primary occupation and activity of most night hags, with the main, and easiest, method of gathering them being to simply wander the Wastes looking for them.[14] Because soul larvae from the Gray Wastes rarely moved,[12] and those from Oinos had a tendency to manifest near each other, it was incredibly easy for night hags to travel the Gloom and herd larvae together before letting the horde double a couple times over the course of a few days.[14] The particularly wicked larvae that hags made from their dream haunting abilities were especially useful to fiends and it was thought that they had the luxury of skipping the mindless stages of lemure or mane. Many fiends actively sought out hags that created such larvae and night hags in turn recognized the profit that could be turned from selling them.[8][14] Despite the obvious benefits, most night hags refrained from using this method due to the time and effort it took to perform and the risk that the practice would attract troublesome forces from the Material Plane. Still, some opportunistic hags still partook in the practice despite its risks, going after powerful beings of great evil, particularly spellcasters that associated with fiends, who would create more valuable larva.[8][14] After disposing of the worst maggots and branding their merchandise they sold the rest to the highest bidders or in pre-arranged contracts, typically only trading the best but occasionally selling those of poor quality at a discount, often times to inexperienced liches.[12][14] Why larvae were so crucial was no question, as the creatures could be eaten, turned into various fiends or used as raw material in several rituals and products. While they could be found throughout the lower planes, night hags centralized their business in the Gray Wastes,[4][14] and sometimes harvested them from the Shadowfell.[9] This was because larvae of the Gray Wastes were of such pure evil that not only could both baatezu and tanar'ri easily adapt them to their alignments, but it was in their best interests to do so. Larva from the Nine Hells were too inflexibly fixed to their form of lawful evil and struggled to take on baatezu form, while those chaotic evil ones from the Abyss were unstable and reverted back into larva too easily.[14] Millions of fiends could die daily in the Blood War and while neither side would ever admit it, they were reliant on the keen eyes and superior location of the night hags to supply them with the best larvae.[14] Other entities that relied on life forces to survive such as liches were minor players in the larva trade but still contributed to the trade and the monopoly held by the hags.[12] With an ever-increasing demand and a practically never-ending supply, the night hags had surely amassed awe-inspiring levels of wealth.[14] Although uncommon, larva trade interruptions, either to ruin or commandeer it, had always happened within the Gray Wastes. The Blood War, ironically, was the biggest issue, as despite attempts to learn where it would strike next, hags were often unexpectedly caught in the middle of Blood War skirmishes and slaughtered along with them, their herd, their servitors and their patrons. Celestials attempting to weaken the forces of evil without making themselves out as targets sometimes conducted covert operations against the nightmare queens, secretly slaughtering them and their herd based on the logic that killing fiends while they were weak was the best strategy, although it was unclear if it actually worked or merely angered the hags.[14] Occasionally the rogue fiend or unscrupulous mortal would attempt to take up the larva trade as an entrepreneur, a practice likely to get them killed before their first deal by their competition and that was never taken seriously.[14] More regular and sporadic disruptions included robbery by liches, small thefts by hungry dhergoloths (which were generally ignored to prevent conflict with the yugoloth race) and attacks by goodly, plane traveling adventurers.[14][17] Typically such intrusions only effected individual hags and the wider-scale larva trade remained unimpeded, although failing to address such attacks was liable to get a hag branded as weak.[14] Hags were willing to associate and ally with various evil creatures from across the planes and sometimes even non-evil ones so long as they weren't good. Those that knew of their existence typically wrote them off as crafty crones that sold larvae for money, while celestials harbored a hatred for them since their activities furthered the fiendish races. While fiends viewed hags more favorably thanks to their service they were also quick to overlook them as a mere merchant race.[12][14] Night hags occasionally became the wives of fiends possessing some semblance of noble status and had been known to adopt seductive appearances in order to get close and steal secrets from mortal wizards. They had been known to found magic colleges or sponsored arcane research projects, regardless of the moral nature of the spellcasters they deceived.[13] Lesser creatures were normally hired to keep records, herd larvae, send messages and complete any other mundane chores, with loyalty being greatly important to them. Those night hags that did pay their workers often did so poorly and terminated any servitor wishing to terminate their employment in order to protect their precious trade secrets. Imps and tieflings made their way into their service as did mephits and the occasional modrons.[14] Often times they mounted nightmares, another type of dream haunting creature of the Gray Wastes, and they prized cauchemar breeds.[8] Although they made contact with servants, customers and hired mercenaries, night hags had little society in regards to one another outside of subjugation and the mutual scorning of the weak.[12][14] They generally preferred to operate their businesses independently of one another, allowing them to keep the entirety of their earnings while not needing to deal with their equally greedy relatives. Thousands of individual night hags dotted Hades, each marketing their own wares while in constant competition with each other. Occasionally night hag covens could be found in the Gray Wastes, formed in order to pool a greater profit than the hags within could earn alone.[14] Night hag covens, often comprised of a night hag and her daughters and sometimes masterminded by another, even stronger night hag, quickly and inexorably fell apart due to in-fighting.[8][14] The longest-lasting coven of night hags ran the largest larva market in the lower planes, the Grand Larva Emporium. A grand bazaar located in Oinos along the River Styx, the Emporium was the commercial center of the Lower Planes where demon, devil, lich or otherwise went to acquire premium larva. Passengers entered via merrenoloth skiffs by the hundreds to browse and buy, protected by a well-armed retinue of yugoloth mercenaries that swiftly executed any trade disruptors.[14] Shoppers haggled with hags that had paid to rent a spot for the day over the prices of their larvae, and could also purchase larva-based products such as a perfume called \"Evil\" or a liquor known as \"Yellow Wurm Stout\". Blood War weaponry and armor, dark magic, slaves, illegal goods and all kinds of other heinous contraband was rumored to make its way through the ultimate black market. The tiefling Malraxus ran a coffee shop the size of a small town called the Blood Grind, where travelers could order exquisite Abyssal coffee and gossip about the latest Blood War news.[14] Most hags when in Hades were nomadic, their need for knowledge having led them to travel throughout the planes through portals, magical items or by contacting others that could. Only the strongest of their kind created lairs within the Gray Wastes, minor, personal empires of lesser fiends, their children and other nightmarish beings from across the planes. Typically night hags made their dwellings on the Material Plane in strategically chosen locales; small cave and hollows, abandoned mines, forested ruins, lone crags, and other grim, isolated spots nearby secluded towns. Either by the traps surrounding the area around a lair, the minions posted around them or by coming across them on their own, night hags were typically alerted about the presence of intruders and did not take to them kindly.[8] Their lairs were in fact two lairs, partially the haunt seen from the Material Plane and partially simple yet dreadful towers of stone and steel constructed in the Ethereal Plane from materials taken from the Prime Material Plane. The immutable firmness of their towers contrasted the phantasmal mist of the ethereal plane and was where night hags spent a large portion of their time on villainous plots and vile rituals. While hags would spend all their time on the Ethereal Plane, as it allowed them to travel easily and protected them from hunters, the threats present there such as unpredictable ether cyclones and fearsome monsters made the Material Plane seem safer. Often times the only use of a lair was as an interplanar prison for important captives and a night hag's children before they fully transformed, a clearly dangerous prison as there were many potential horrors lurking in the Ethereal Plane, but one that hags loved to leave their victims in regardless for their own enjoyment.[8] Powerful night hags such as grandmas or aunties had even more terrible lairs, with the nearby region becoming more warped and eerie around them. Shadows could seem emaciated and might move on their own, people would have visions of dead family, friends and possibly themselves that would disappear if interfered with and people could randomly disappear only to return a minute or so later, having been temporarily shifted to a demiplane full of wicked cackling, shadows and corpses. Within their lairs, such hags were even more dangerous, able to throw people into the air without touching them and banish others to special prison demiplanes for a few brief seconds.[11] Dream haunting night hags slowly savored their kills from the safety of their hideouts, first targeting community outcasts such as criminals and deviants. At first this was ignored or even seen as a positive until important figures or those whose crimes were unknown to the populace began dying in their sleep. Befitting the disease-using nature of night hags, the deaths they caused were often mistaken as a kind of supernatural plague resistant to all forms of healing, leading some to try to quarantine the area and thus accidentally leave the people trapped within in the clutches of the hag. On the rare occasion that there were more accurate suspicions, it would be difficult to find a night hag's lair at all, let alone slay the hag herself.[8] Cegilune, mixing her brew. The mother and goddess of hags, Cegilune, dwelt within the Gray Wastes along with the majority of night hags and was rumored to be a supremely powerful night hag herself.[12][15] She tyrannically commanded the night hags to procure soul larvae for her to use in trades with tanar'ri and liches, although she wouldn't take the souls of those that other night hags had corrupted due to her greed and mistrust for her own servitors.[18] She was paradoxically worshiped and reviled by all night hags and in turn showed only callous disregard for the wellbeing of her daughters, maintaining her position through overwhelming power.[12][14][15] The nightmare queens of Hades never needed to sleep themselves,[8] although it was rumored that they went through vulnerable periods where they had to take great care to protect themselves.[12] Night hags enjoyed the taste of flesh and souls, either from their own larva herds or from innocent mortals.[8][12] They were also rumored to consume hopes and dreams, a fitting theory for denizens of the Gray Wastes.[12] Although many theorized that night hags were some strange adaptation of soul larva, none could deny the enigmatic connection between the worms and the witches.[8][12] Indeed, soul larva did play a role in the reproduction of night hags, who had a uniquely disturbing method of procreation that set them apart from other hags. After seducing mortal men, normally having to disguise themselves first, night hags became pregnant for an amount of time typical for her mate's species and produced an otherwise ordinary, dark-haired daughter. After her first birthday, a night hag could perform a series of mysterious, corrupting ceremonies on their children that would transform them into a hag. Rituals had to be performed thirteen days after the last and involved the night hag suckling the child and feeding the child living larva flesh, a process that took an hour. After the last rite, the child would swiftly and irreversibly transform into a night hag within an hour. If one of the feedings was interrupted, they couldn't reach the child on the appropriate days or the child hit puberty, the child would be forever safe from transformation.[8] Hags could also sire children from fiends and daughters wrought from such a method were always hags and took no traits from their fathers.[13] If hags could die of old age then their lifespans far exceeded those of even dragons and they were practically immortal.[11] Night hags lacked maternal instincts or any true concern for their daughters and so on they always left their children in the care of others. Typically they were left in the hands of unwary, good-aligned beings, these being one of the few times they didn't murder them, or even the birth father, who had a half and half chance of still being alive after the hag mated with him. Rarely were their daughters anything more than reserves kept across the planes for them to return to later if they needed more assistance, so many hagborn children went untransformed.[12] Superstition and old stories shrouded the history of the night hags as legends and wives' tales about their actions diluted accurate information about them. Some simply believed them to be another hag variant alongside the sea and green hags that dwelt on a different plane.[8] Others pointed to the blue skin and black horn nubs of the annis hags and concluded that the two were especially related somehow.[19] Some earlier reports claimed that green hags were the degenerate result of night hags breeding with mortals and that annis hags were the result of green hags breeding with ogres and giants, which would make all three related.[20] There was speculation, due to their link to soul larva, that night hags originated from them or were a refinement of the hateful hordlings that ravaged the Gray Wastes.[15] More esoteric beliefs involved the idea that they were an embodiment of mortal dreams, or more appropriately nightmares,[21] while more recent reports claimed that the night hags were once native to the Feywild before their extreme evil led to them being banished to Hades where they became fiendish degenerates.[1] Regardless of their own origins, night hags, typically those working in covens, could be credited with the creation of several horrors, such as the silent Shadowfell monsters known as the banderhobbs or the original ritual for the boneclaw from ogre remains and a trapped oni soul.[22][23] Even the yugoloths were rumored to have been created by a Gehennan night hag sisterhood working under Asmodeus to create an army not bound by the Nine Hells. Supposedly the hags were the ones who made the Books of Keeping that contained the true names of all original yugoloths, sans the General of Gehenna, as well as a few demon lords and archdevils, but lost the books and split up thanks to the bickering common the night hag covens.[24] Yugoloths had their own creation stories, some of which explained certain details better than the night hag version, but none so that explained the existence of the altroloths so well.[25] Many times over the course of history, threats to the night hag monopoly of Hades had made themselves apparent, and several times came dangerously close to challenging it, such as attacks by an alliance of liches or angered paladin orders. When not even the united efforts of the night hags could best such threats they were forced to fall back on their champions, the altroloths. How exactly the night hags came across the recipe for them, whether it was discovered by Cegilune or the baernoloths (unlikely given the disregard both the goddess and the enigmatic creatures displayed to their respective followers) or if a coven merely discovered it on their own was unknown. Regardless of how they got it, and whether or not other fiends could be used in it, night hags in dire straights would temporarily put aside their differences and create a champion from a willing yugoloth.[14] Despite the fact that such knowledge would make them more intimidating, night hags and yugoloths alike kept the ability for them to do so a secret because of the hidden drawback that came with the creation of altraloths. Creating an altraloth was so incredibly taxing for the night hags involved that they would be rendered helpless for months if not years after. Numerous things could go wrong and the process could still fail for seemingly no reason, but if it succeeded their champion could be bestowed with incredible powers or even have their alignment changed as needed, making it one of the greatest tools in the arsenal of the night hags. It was through their ability to create altraloths that the hags earned unrestricted and free ferry service on the River Styx forever by making its keeper, Charon.[14] Other Fiends\nAchaierai \u2022 Barghest \u2022 Canomorph (Haraknin \u2022 Shadurakul) \u2022 Hell hound \u2022 Hordling \u2022 Howler \u2022 Larva \u2022 Maelephant \u2022 Marrashi \u2022 Night hag \u2022 Nightmare \u2022 Rakshasa \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Vargouille \u2022 Yeth hound",

        "description": "      Nightmares were seemingly emaciated stallions, approximately 6\u202ffeet (1.8\u202fmeters) tall at the shoulders, with night-black coats.[4][6] On further examination, however, their warhorse-like exterior was revealed to be entirely superficial. They had huge heads, fangs like vipers, and malevolent dark eyes often illuminated by red-hot flames, and they spouted orange fire when their nostrils flared.[3][6] Wreathed in fire, their manes were wild and their tails unkempt, but they turned to cinders and quickly dispersed upon death.[2][4] Their steely hooves left scorch marks wherever they went but the tracks left mysterious patterns and gaps.[3][7] They galloped through the night with unnatural agility, their black bodies blending into the darkness and leaving onlookers with only the sight of racing, infernal flames that appeared and disappeared in smokescreens of brimstone.[1][7] Rumors had it that the creatures moved so fast that they could only be seen as a blur, but those who'd seen them speculated they could move between shadows or teleport, which would explain their ability to stop and start in an instant and suddenly appear without seeming to have moved.[7] Nightmares were callous and cruel creatures that stalked those they could victimize. They displayed hatred towards all life on the Material Plane and exhibited an infernal intelligence unseen in true beasts.[4][7] Rather than simply murder their targets, they used their supernatural powers to strike terror in them first, making them fear for their lives and killing them once they were reduced to panicking wrecks. One of their favorite tricks was to allow their victims one last moment of feeling safe before suddenly reappearing, dashing their last remaining hope, and then striking the killing blow.[7] Despite being wild and roaming creatures, they were known to serve willingly as mounts during missions of malice, but only for those of sufficient wickedness and ability.[3] Those that wished to ride them would be wise to remember that nightmares were not simple steeds but fiercely independent and untameable fiends with their own instincts and agendas. Prideful and egotistical, nightmares often acted upon their own wills even if such actions ran counter to the goals of their supposed masters and sometimes even at their expense.[4][7] Even if both parties desired to commit evil deeds, their exact methodologies could be incompatible and attempts to force them into servitude often ended poorly. Only after forging a bond with them over time would a nightmare become loyal to a rider and only then would the two become true partners in villainy.[7][8] The titular power of nightmares was their ability to appear in dreams, either before the victim had encountered them in the flesh in a kind of ill omen or in the minds of survivors after a terrifying attack.[7] They could shift to the astral and ethereal planes, as well as the Shadowfell, at will, and despite their lack of wings they could magically fly even faster than they ran.[3][7] Their hooves typically ignited flammable objects and they could leave massive walls of fire in their wake.[2][3] Nightmares were often surrounded by a haze of smoke thick enough to prevent others from seeing them but which they could see through perfectly. They often exhaled a searing, sulfurous smoke in the midst of combat, neighing in fits of rage while snorting out the noxious gas. The blinding, choking cloud left enemies caught within it wheezing and unable to properly fight back against the nightmare.[3] Nightmares could inflict deaths so gruesome they could create enraged and vengeful phantoms.[7] With tooth and hoof, nightmares savaged most creatures they came across. Beings from the lower planes were typically spared from their fury but other entities weren't so lucky, particularly those from the Material Plane.[4] They utilized hit-and-run tactics, targeting separated members of groups and blocking off means of escape through fires, speed, and their ability to move between planes.[2] Only skilled riders could properly fight with a nightmare while riding on top of it.[3] Nightmares of the Shadowfell were unique in their tendency to hunt in small, predatory herds similar to wolf packs. They haunted untraveled roads, either in the Shadowfell or Material Plane, looking for the rare, night-going wanderers to prey upon.[2][7] Passages known as \"ember ways\", so-called because of the smoking hoofprints left behind in the wake of their makers, were regarded as dangerous paths even by the denizens of the Shadowfell and even during the day.[7] The gloomy realms of the Gray Wastes and the bleak Shadowfell were most closely linked to nightmares, but they could be found and shaped by other planes\u2014for example, the Abyss had mutated its nightmares into demonic variants.[7] Such nightmares were usually lone wanderers that murdered individuals and smaller groups, but those with herds shared tighter bonds and possessed unique social structures not found elsewhere.[4][7] Sin's Reward, a nightmare barded in spiked, black armor and cloaked in black smoke and white flames, was the master of all nightmares in the Nine Hells. Meanwhile the mares of the Abyss were commanded by the mutant mare Thunder of Hooves, a massive, six-legged nightmare that ruled through violence and intimidation. Despite their mutual hatred of one another, the two mated annually in the Shadowfell, producing three powerful foals: one would go to the Abyss, one to the Hells, and one would stay in the Shadowfell.[7] On rare occasions, somewhere between a year and a decade, a sinister night came for all beings of evil known as the Gloom Meet. The denizens of the Lower Planes, as well as the Shadowfell, met together in the Glooms of Hades to conduct dark diplomacy: settling their differences, creating new alliances, and discussing future agendas. Two weeks before the Gloom Meet began, nightmares heralded its coming, racing across the planes and becoming more noticeable throughout the multiverse, particularly in the Gray Wastes. In the final moments before the Meet, nightmares charged in a terrifying stampede towards their final destination, leaving a trail of hoofprint-shaped scorch marks behind them.[4][5][7] It was by following them that a few planar scholars and adventurers found the Gloom Meet themselves, allowing infrequent accounts of such meetings to exist.[7] A nightmare with its flaming mane. Nightmares were favored mounts among many malevolent races, to the point where there existed an Order of the Nightmare, a company named for their steeds. Night hags were known to ride them but they were primarily ridden by powerful and intelligent demons and devils, particularly narzugons, who treated them as trusted and valued companions.[4][9] Certain undead like death knights, liches, vampires and even specters also took them as mounts.[7] Mortal spellcasters, wicked warriors,[7] and anti-paladins[10] sought out nightmares for power and acclaim and the shadar-kai prized them as steeds.[11] Their burning manes were not a problem for riders as they granted those atop them fire resistance.[7] Taming a nightmare typically required complete domination of the creature, with it and its potential rider dueling to determine its fate. Only when it was clear the only alternative was death would nightmares submit, but they didn't lose their individuality and wouldn't blindly follow commands.[7] Mortals wishing to bind a nightmare into service could use a combination of the summon monster and wall of fog spells to bring them to the Material Plane. Appearing through the mist, the nightmare had to be fed an appropriate offering: 20 pieces worth of platinum, ground into oat-like flakes that it consume. Whoever fed them would be their master for three days. Beings of the Lower Planes didn't need to do this, but whatever agreement they made was unknown to mortals.[4] It was also possible to bind nightmares using infernal tack\u2014typically reserved for narzugons\u2014which allowed the wearer of the magical set of spurs to call the nightmare from across the planes.[8] Nightmares had no actual connection to real horses and were only semi-material beings lacking the need to breathe, although they could become tired.[4][12] They could easily carry hundreds of pounds and, so long as there was space on their backs, could carry any amount of undead. Up to 120\u202fpounds (54\u202fkilograms) of gold could be carried to and from the ethereal plane along with their riders.[12] Nightmares, even though incapable of speech, could communicate between each other through some form of empathy.[4] Nightmares never required food although they typically consumed their slaughtered enemies.[4] They had a preference for the meat of humans, demihumans, and lesser fiends, with manes and lemures being particular favorites, but specific tastes could vary widely between individuals. If not provided with such delicacies at least once a month, they had a mild tendency to exhibit hostile behavior.[12] If nightmares did need some form of nourishment (difficult to prove because of their ability to digest inorganic matter), it was likely they derived sustenance simply by perpetrating evil acts.[4] Nightmares could be found all across the evil-aligned planes from Acheron to Pandemonium.[13] They could be seen racing throughout Carceri in the acidic jungles of Cathrys and the blasting deserts of Minethys as well as in the fire and magma flows on Gehenna.[14] Lesser nightmares (thought to be bred from their stronger kin) were equally despicable but more cautious. While incapable of transitioning between planes at will, they were still able to move between them with passengers and had an impeccable sense of direction. They immediately attempted to escape good creatures that attempted to ride them but were excellent teammates for blackguards.[15] Cauchemars, on the other hand, were a particularly powerful and vile breed of nightmare that struck fear in even the bravest champions. Their smoke was even more overpowering, and they could carry over twice as much as regular nightmares.[3] Whether or not nightmares could truly, naturally reproduce was a point of contention, but a method existed for creating them.[4][1] A ritual of dark magic could transform a pegasus into a nightmare with the agonizing removal of its wings, and it would lose its noble qualities for despicable traits.[1] Aging nightmares showed gray hairs on their black coats or a hunched posture.[4] When their time of death approached, nightmares made their way to the third layer of Hades, Pluton, to a spot called the Hill of Bone to die, normally bringing ruin to their former masters in the process.[16] The Hill of Bone was a massive graveyard, a mountainous heap of bones shaped like a giant equine skeleton when viewed from above. Permeated by an eerie silence, the only noises that could be heard were the occasional whinnies and chuffs, even when no living nightmares were present. The barely audible rattling of bones was a constant background noise and sometimes the area that formed the legs or head shifted as if to signify victory. Appearing from walls of mist, elderly nightmares occasionally cantered onto the Hill of Bone, saluting it with their heads held high. The Hill responded with its own welcome, an ear-splitting neigh that resounded up to a mile away and could drive listeners mad. When the echoes faded, the nightmare would immediately fall over dead and its skin would rot off alarmingly quickly.[4][16] The enigmatic happenings on the Hill of Bones belied its true nature as the means by which nightmares achieved immortality alongside their ancient ancestors. The removal of a single, scrap of bone was seen as a grave violation by the entirety of the nightmare race, prompting every member to hunt down the offender, return what was stolen, and exact retribution on behalf of their forebears. The feeling of being watched on the Hill of Bone was thanks to the skulls, all of which possessed truesight and could still communicate, allowing them to give descriptions of graverobbers. The theft was reported to the next nightmare that came to die, which would quickly circulate the information. If the nightmares failed to retrieve the remains, normally stopping after the death of three more of their kind in the hunt for it, the nightmare whose bone was stolen was doomed to permanently die and have its life force spread throughout Hades.[16] Dying on the Hill was paramount for nightmares and some prearranged for their bodies to be moved there even if they died on other planes.[4] The devil duke Alloces claimed to have created the original nightmares alongside numerous other bestial monsters and curses, but few scholars, wizardly or religious, outside of his own followers believed him.[17] Sin's Reward and Thunder of Hooves were rumored to have been agents of Vecna sent to spy on and report back on the activities of devils and demons. Further speculations were that the two had been corrupted by their respective planes and that Vecna wanted both dead.[7] Black Onyx and Eversmoke were two highly prized nightmares in the possession of Marrake al-Sidan al-Hariq ben Lazan, Grand Sultan of All Efreet. They ran races in the City of Brass.[18] Bloodcurdle was the favored mount of the Hag Countess the former ruler of Malbolge, before she was supplanted by Glasya. Although he initially pretended to submit, he revealed he was truly loyal to the Countess by hurling her into a lake of bile, earning him a private torture room in the Tower of Pain.[19] Bloodfire was a cauchemar and the willing steed of the Baron of Blood, Artor Morlin.[20] Other Fiends\nAchaierai \u2022 Barghest \u2022 Canomorph (Haraknin \u2022 Shadurakul) \u2022 Hell hound \u2022 Hordling \u2022 Howler \u2022 Larva \u2022 Maelephant \u2022 Marrashi \u2022 Night hag \u2022 Nightmare \u2022 Rakshasa \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Vargouille \u2022 Yeth hound",

The first loan was to Widow Silvermane who ran a lottery in the North Ward of Waterdeep, and the second noe went to the Field of Triumph Race Track in the Sea Ward. The astronomical loans were caused by goddess' Tymoras luck going out of control all over the Realms. Every single gambler picked the winning number and winning horses, costing Widow Silvermane and the Field of Triumph disastrous losses.[9]\nIn 1370 DR, a skeleton dressed in Cassalanter family garb was seen attacking several Waterdhavians. These incidents attracted the attention of the city's Lords of Waterdeep. The undead came from the family's old crypt in Undermountain, and a lone hero was sent to investigate the restless Cassalanter ancestors. The hero successfully destroyed the undead and the ghoul necromancer behind the infestation, Ghoulmaster and the noble family offered a hefty reward for the deed.[7]\nIn the late 15th century DR, the Cassalanters faced imminent bankruptcy. In order to prevent it, in 1489 DR[note 1] Ammalia and Victoro struck a deal with the archdevil Asmodeus, trading the souls of their children in exchange for instant financial comeback.

The Cassalanter (pronounced: /\u02c8k\u00e6s\u0251\u02d0l\u0251\u02d0nt\u025br/ CASS-ah-lan-ter[3], or: /\u02c8k\u0251\u02d0s\u0251\u02d0l\u0251\u02d0nt\u025br/ KAS-ah-lan-ter[4]) noble house of Waterdeep was among one of the richest families within the city,[5] having made their fortune in banking, money-lending and rumor-mongering for the highest payer.[2] Map showing the location of the Cassalanter Villa (labeled $48) circa 1372 DR. The family had a villa in the Sea Ward, on the southwest corner of Delzorin Street and Diamond Street.[6] The Cassalanter family had an ancient burial crypt in the Dungeon Level of Undermountain with several of the family ancestors interred there. A Shrine of Myrkul was the part of the family crypt.[7] House Cassalanter was ennobled in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR when the Lords of Waterdeep recognized several merchant houses and granted them noble titles and seals.[8] In 1368 DR, Cassalanters loaned two ten-million golden lions with a huge interest rate. The first loan was to Widow Silvermane who ran a lottery in the North Ward of Waterdeep, and the second noe went to the Field of Triumph Race Track in the Sea Ward. The astronomical loans were caused by goddess' Tymoras luck going out of control all over the Realms. Every single gambler picked the winning number and winning horses, costing Widow Silvermane and the Field of Triumph disastrous losses.[9] In 1370 DR, a skeleton dressed in Cassalanter family garb was seen attacking several Waterdhavians. These incidents attracted the attention of the city's Lords of Waterdeep. The undead came from the family's old crypt in Undermountain, and a lone hero was sent to investigate the restless Cassalanter ancestors. The hero successfully destroyed the undead and the ghoul necromancer behind the infestation, Ghoulmaster and the noble family offered a hefty reward for the deed.[7] In the late 15th century DR, the Cassalanters faced imminent bankruptcy. In order to prevent it, in 1489 DR[note 1] Ammalia and Victoro struck a deal with the archdevil Asmodeus, trading the souls of their children in exchange for instant financial comeback. Their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately and transformed into a chain devil, while the younger twins Elzerina and Terenzio were scheduled to be taken on the occasion of their 9th birthday, one tenday after Founders' Day of 1492 DR.[10] The 15th\u2012century Cassalanters: (left to right) Terenzio, Elzerina, Ammalia, and Victoro.

A mature ochre jelly reached up to 15\u202ffeet (4.6\u202fmeters) in diameter and around 6\u202finches (15\u202fcentimeters) thick. However, it could compress its mass to fit through gaps of only 1\u202finch (2.5\u202fcentimeters). Moreover, it had a mass of 5,600\u202fpounds (2,500\u202fkilograms).[3] They lurked in dungeons, slowly creeping along floors, walls, and ceilings and under and through doors and cracks looking for victims.[3][2] When they were found, the ochre jelly extended itself and latched onto a victim, proceeding to constrict and engulf them. The jelly exuded pseudopods to slam and grapple foes in combat.[3] If cut, an ochre jelly could split into two similar, but smaller, offspring.[3] Ochre jellies were known to exist in the dungeon of X\u00fbl-Jarak in Thar.[6] They could also be found in the ruins of the Ulcaster school near Beregost.[7] In the Abyss, ochre jellies could be found in Shedaklah, the Slime Pits, the 222nd layer of the Abyss.[8] They were favored by the drow deity Ghaunadaur.[9]",

        "description": "      Ogres appeared as giant humanoids with very muscular bodies and large heads. They stood between 9 and 10 feet tall and could weigh 600 to 650 lbs.[3] Ogres were a lazy, brutish, avaricious race with notoriously quick tempers.[1] Their avaricious nature would often lead them distrust one another and incite squabbling over treasure.[4] Ogres generally preferred to rely on ambushing their foes and overwhelming them through sheer numbers.[3] In terms of weapons, ogres were typically seen to use uprooted trees and stone-tipped javelins.[1] Much like hill giants, ogres were gluttonous creatures willing to eat almost anything. They enjoyed the taste of raw dwarf flesh, but would also eat halfling or elf flesh when they could get it.[9][1] They would often use the skin and bones of their prey to fashion crude loincloths and necklaces.[1] Ogres were known to typically associate with goblinoids, orcs, and their fellow giant-kin trolls. In the social structure of the giants, the Ordning, ogres were considered the lowest-ranked of all giant-kin. Because of this, they were typically found to be willing servants of giants.[1] The giant races they were most often seen working alongside were hill giants and verbeeg, the former of which they often traded with for trinkets or food.[10] Many ogres worked as mercenaries, hoping for easy plunder,[3] and in that line of work they were often seen alongside verbeeg.[11] Lone hags, as well as covens, were known to employ ogres as guards, while others polymorphed ogres and sent them out to work as spies.[12] Ogres spoke Jogishk, a patois of the Giant or Jotun tongue.[3][7] Ogres typically worshiped Vaprak the Destroyer as their patron god.[6] Though many also practically worshiped the true giants.[1] According to legend, the ogre race was formed when Othea, wife of the titan Annam All-Father, had an affair with Vaprak.[14] Ogres overwhelm Priam Agrivar, Vajra Valmeyjar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright. In 1357 DR, a small army of ogres served the monstrous extraplanar being Imgig Zu. He gathered them in the caverns beneath his tower to witness the Great Awakening of his people from Sel\u00fbne's Eye, and to provide defense during the deed. The heroes Priam Agrivar, Vajra Valmeyjar, Timoth Eyesbright, and Onyx the Invincible fought through the ogres to confront Imgig and free Cybriana. Though the ogres clubbed them down and caught them, the roof of the cavern miraculously tore open and the brilliant light of the full moon shone through, blinding the ogres long enough for Priam to slay Imgig. As the ritual was undone, the surviving ogres fled.[9] True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

        "description": "   Besides great strength, many oni had regenerative abilities similar to trolls, and all oni had multiple magical abilities, including the ability to fly without wings, change their own shape, and turn themselves invisible.[2] There were many varieties of oni. The most common were: Oni enjoyed both dancing and music. They particularly enjoyed the music of flutes. It was considered unwise to interrupt an oni dancing celebration![3] Among animals, oni preferred black-colored ones.[3] Oni also were very fond of treasures of all varieties. Some oni would swallow their treasures to protect them, regurgitating them later.[3] Oni often lived in desolate areas,[4] or they might make homes along highways or within cities, living in disguise. In rare cases, they might even rule over small human villages.[3] A band of oni might contain a hundred members, in obedience to the largest and wisest oni, whether male or female. They might be found allied with bakemono, gaki, goblin rats, or varieties of evil humanoids.[3] Oni had their own language, but spoke other languages as well.[3] Oni were carnivorous and had massive appetites. They ate both wild game and domesticated animals, and would eat humanoids as well.[3] Males and females were equally powerful.[3] The origin of oni remained a mystery to scholars. Many believed that they were the corrupted spirits of evil humans, but others thought them to have been created specifically by the Celestial Bureaucracy to test humans and establish a balance between good and evil.[3] Still others saw many similarities between the oni of the east and the ogres of the west and argued that they were in fact related races,[6][7][8][9][10] or that oni were related to trolls.[9] Other sages told the tale that oni were descended from the god Vaprak's three sons, Anori, Hakuni, and Muaj.[9] It was said that an island populated almost exclusively by oni was said to exist somewhere in the Celestial Sea, but if true, no human explorer had ever found the island and returned. Strangely, the island was said to be guarded by thousands of one-foot tall black oni with powers as great as larger oni.[3] It was rumored that amethysts could repel oni.[11]  True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

        "description": "   Orcs varied in appearance, based on region and subrace, but all shared certain physical qualities. Orcs of all kinds usually had grayish skin, coarse hair, stooped postures, low foreheads, large muscular bodies, and porcine faces that featured lower canines that resembled boar tusks. Many also had wolf-like ears that were pointed on the ends, similar to elves. Orcs were roughly the same size as humans and other similar humanoids, though usually robust and muscular.[8] While not strictly subraces the result of a human and orc breeding is known as a half-orc while the offspring of a half-fiend and orc is a tanarukk.[citation needed] Orcs had poor temperaments and were given to anger more easily than some races. Easily offended and impatient, orcs generally preferred violent solutions and rarely considered multiple ways of approaching a problem. However, in spite of this many orcs were excellent at getting results, since they were creatures of action, not thought. Some exceptions to this profile did exist, however, such as the famed King Obould whose deeds were accomplished through planning and insight.[11] Traditional orcish culture was extremely warlike and when not at war the race was usually planning for it. Most orcs approached life with the belief that to survive, one had to subjugate potential enemies and control as many resources as possible, which put them naturally at odds with other races as well as each other. This belief was spurred in part by Gruumsh and his pantheon, which taught that all races were inferior to the orcs.[12] Eyes of Gruumsh were orcs specially tied to the one-eyed god and offered sacrifices, read omens and advised tribes through Gruumsh's will.[13] Most orcs were part of a confederation of tribes, loosely held together by a despotic chieftain. Bands within these alliances might have wandered far from their homelands, but continued to greet those orcs who belonging to the same tribal network as kin.[14] Orc bloodragers were champions of their tribe, who used primal strength and ferocity to overcome their enemies. Most were bodyguards or lower-ranking chiefs within the tribal structure.[13] Male orcs dominated most orcish societies and females were usually, at best, prized possessions and little better than livestock at worst. Male orcs prided themselves on their number of wives and sons, as well as their scars from battle and rituals. Orcs also prized the possession of slaves, though relatively few owned them.[12] Most orcs didn't build cities of their own, instead relying on those left behind by others and improving their fortifications or operating out of small camps and dens, often in natural caves. Orcs managed ironwork on their own, as well as stonework, though their tools were often inferior to those of more disciplined races.[14] Orcs were found in many parts of Toril, though some areas had a higher concentration than others. Marauding bands of mountain orcs were most commonly found in mountain ranges in the northern parts of the world, particularly around Faer\u00fbn. Gray orcs were commonly found to the east, near the portal from which they emerged in High Imaskar. The orcs in the Sword Mountains were responsible for several conflicts with Waterdeep, including the Orcfastings War, and an onslaught caused by the Black Claw. They were also at least partially responsible for the Trollwars.[citation needed] However, of all the orcish homelands, Many-Arrows probably stood out the most as the only civilized orc nation built along the same lines as its human and elven neighbors.[citation needed] A subset of orcs belonging to a state first formed a century ago[citation needed] by the legendary Obould Many-Arrows differed from the majority of their kin in cultural attitudes. While most orcs were warlike and savage, the orcs of Many-Arrows, ruled over by King Obould XVII, were remarkably civilized, to a point that has made their neighbors curious. These orcs maintained a tenuous peace with the dwarves of Mithral Hall and the other races in Luruar, though many suspected war could break out at any moment should the delicate balance between the races be upset.[15] It is from this region that the most unusual kind of orc would sometimes emerge - heroes.[11] Orcish cuisine was notoriously unpalatable for many other races. Some compared the taste of their goulashes to the taste of an old soldier's boot. Some even went as far as to claim that orcs did, in fact, use discarded shoes in their cooking.[16] Orcs bred fast and lived short lives compared with most other races. They were considered adults anywhere between 11 and 14 years of age, middle-aged at 17, old at 23, and venerable at 35 years of age. The average orc seldom lived longer than 40 years, even if it managed to avoid violent death. It was unheard of for an orc to live longer than 45 years without magical aid.[17] Adult male orcs generally stood between 59 and 71 inches tall, and adult females averaged two inches shorter. Males weighed in anywhere between 136 and 190 pounds, while females weighed between 96 and 150 pounds.[17] The origin of the orcs was unknown, though they appeared to be non-native to either Abeir or Toril.[citation needed] The first legends of orcs told of the wars between their primary god Gruumsh and Corellon Larethian, the creator of the elves and eladrin. The latter two races told of how Corellon defeated Gruumsh and took his eye; though many orcs denied this charge, saying that he always had the one eye and that Corellon cheated with magic because he couldn't win in fair combat.[18][19] However, in spite of this early conflict, orcs did not appear en masse until long after this. During the Days of Thunder when Abeir-Toril was yet united the first orcs were brought over to the world by the creator races, who built a portal in the Spine of the World mountain range that opened up to the home plane of the orcs. Through this portal the ancestors of the mountain orcs poured through and gradually migrated southwards.[20] Later, the Imaskari repeated the mistake of the creator races, opening up another portal through which the gray orcs, a variant subrace, appeared. This led to the Orcgate Wars during which Gruumsh and his allies slew most of the Untheric pantheon.[21] Eventually, the portal was closed, though the new breed of orcs remained behind. For millennia orcs have plagued civilizations as raiders and pillaging hordes but more recently[as of when?] a confederacy of orc tribes united under the banner of King Obould Many-Arrows, a chosen of Gruumsh, forged a more civilized nation known as the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, located along the northern borders of Luruar. In spite of tensions between the orcs of Many-Arrows and other nations, the kingdom has not waged war against its neighbors for decades and by all appearances seems interested in peace.[22]",

        "description": "   Otyughs were strange-looking creatures, with bloated, oval-shaped bodies around 8\u202ffeet (2.4\u202fmeters) wide that stood on three shuffling elephantine legs and had a disgusting, rock-like hide. They had a pair of long tentacles that were bedecked in rough thorny growths and ended in leaf-shaped pads bearing rows of more sharp spikes. A third tentacle sprouted from the top of the otyugh's body, forming a vine-like stalk standing some 2\u202ffeet (61\u202fcentimeters) high, and ended in a pair of eyes and an olfactory organ. The body of the creature contained a massive fang-filled mouth, shaped like a crude gash through its center. A typical otyugh was around 500\u202fpounds (230\u202fkilograms) in mass.[3] An otyugh's body motion when running. Despite its appearance and habits, an otyugh was somewhat intelligent and capable of speech in the Common tongue.[3] Due to the nature of the otyughs' appetites, their mouths were filthy and often carried diseases like filth fever, inflicted with a bite.[3] Otyughs were generally content to stay hidden in their lairs, usually only attacking living creatures if they felt threatened or hungry. They would slash prey with their thorny tentacles, or use them to grab and squeeze creatures and drag them into their maws.[3] In the Arena of Blood in Manshaka, hungry otyughs were kept to devour the carcasses of the slain, but they would seize an unlucky contestant given the chance. In the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, Vajra Valmeyjar drove a troll into its tentacles.[10] In 1357 DR, otyughs could occasionally be found in the sewers of Waterdeep.[11] Dwelling primarily underground, otyughs could be found skulking among piles of refuse and waste. They made such places their lairs, or else gathered refuse to fill their lairs. An otyugh spent the majority of time in its lair, burying itself in trash with only the sensory stalk protruding above the heap. It sat for hours on end, shoveling \"food\" into its maw with its tentacles.[3] Otyughs were primarily omnivorous scavengers. They could consume almost all kinds of refuse and waste, such as carrion, offal, and many other things others would view as garbage. Nevertheless, they would take fresh meat when they had the chance.[3] In the nation of Thay, otyughs could be found in the Surmarsh.[12][13] A hungry otyugh waits to devour the loser of a fight in the Arena of Blood. Because of their habits, otyughs were often viewed as a convenient means of garbage disposal by many intelligent creatures dwelling underground. They would dump their garbage and waste in otyugh lairs, which would, most of the time, not attack them.[3] They were also employed as guardian creatures in sewers and other foul areas.[14] For example, an amphibious otyugh was kept as a guardian for the sewer and river channel beneath the Temple of Mystra in Wheloon in the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR. Instead of waste, it was fed regularly with fresh seafood: live shrimp, lobsters, and crabs.[14]",

While doing so, such birds were so vicious and determined to kill the owl that they loss all sense of caution.[4] The goddess Sel\u00fbne was known to show her favor or presence by sending owls as an omen or guide.[9][10][11]",

        "description": "      Owlbears were monstrous beasts with the bodies of bears covered in thick shaggy coats of both bristly fur and feathers,[6][4][3][1] ranging in coloration from yellowish brown to a brownish black.[8][6][4] Fur was predominant on their bodies, while feathers became more common at their heads, and they had thick hides.[7] Their heads were avian, like those of owls, with large round eyes[4][1] with limpid pupils[1] and rimmed in red.[8][6][4] Their beaks were hooked[4] or serrated[1] and had a yellow to dull ivory hue.[8][6][4] Their claws were fleshy and, being avian, could be counted as talons.[3][11][12] Their terrible screeches were known to split the night and echo across the land as a warning to others.[3][1] Those who'd had run-ins with them and lived often described bestial insanity in its eyes. A little larger and heavier than females, a fully grown male specimen stood 8\u202ffeet (2.4\u202fmeters) high and weighed 1,300 to 1,500\u202fpounds (590 to 680\u202fkilograms),[7][8][6][4] had 2\u2011inch (5.1\u2011centimeter) claws, and darker coats than females.[7][8][6] An owlbear (side view). Other traits were less obvious but still significant. An owlbear could rotate its forearms as a human could, granting it greater strength and agility than a regular bear, giving it a wider range of attack, and enabling it to 'hug' and grapple prey. Moreover, while it had forward-facing eyes like both bears and owls, it also could rotate its head up to 270\u00b0, owing to it having fourteen neckbones (humans had seven and could only turn through 180\u00b0), and it could whip its head around with shocking speed. They had a transparent third eyelid (known as a nictitating membrane) to guard against dust, dirt, and bright light. Unusually, an owlbear's ears were asymmetric, with one somewhat higher than the other, letting it exactly locate the origin of any sound. Finally, owlbears had the same long tongues as bears, so it could lap up liquids the same way.[13] They could be surrounded by a pungent stink.[14] Little more intelligent than most animals,[8][6][1] with more cunning than an owl,[3] these creatures were incredibly aggressive and obstinate and were famous for their ferocity and foul temper. They would go so far as to attack almost anything that moved\u2014anything larger than a mouse and anything they thought they could kill\u2014on sight and without any provocation.[7][8][6][4][2][3][1] They hunted so heavily because of their insatiable appetites, more than that of a giant owl and a bear combined.[8][6][3] A hungry owlbear feared nothing, not even superior strength and size or any other discouragement[3][1] or obstacle or impediment,[6] and with little instinct for self-preservation, they would fight to the death.[7][8][6][4][3] Only one that had already fed well was disinclined to attack a superior foe or risk its life.[15] However, an owlbear's ferocity was also its key weakness\u2014they could be easily lured into a trap or tricked into charging off a cliff, if available.[6] Owlbears could be either diurnal or nocturnal, according to the habits of the local prey.[6][4][2] This arose from them being hybrids of the diurnal bear and the nocturnal owl.[6] Normally, owlbears would wake at midday, hunt daytime prey through afternoon and nocturnal prey through the evening, and go to sleep around midnight.[6] Nocturnal owlbears from around sunset to the darkest hours before sunrise.[3][1] Owlbears hibernated through the cold season and were most active in summer.[6] Owlbears communicated via hooting and screeching, at high volume and with a range of pitches and durations.[6][16] They hooted or screeched to signal their territory and to drive prey into their hunting grounds. Owlbears also screeched as a way to attract a mate.[3][1] An owlbear's eating habits are not particularly pleasant. Owlbears were entirely carnivorous.[5][6][4][2][3][1][13] They typically preyed on animals like rabbits, bears, snakes and other reptiles, but also preyed on trolls.[6] Some claimed owlbears especially enjoyed the taste of elves.[14] When an owlbear successfully caught its prey, it tended to consume part of it on the spot, before dragging the rest back to its lair to be stored, with parts of the carcass stashed amongst or hanging on rocks, bushes, and trees.[6][3][1] An owlbear would also scavenge a carcass.[17] Owlbears tore their prey into chunks and swallowed these whole as owls did. Moreover, in the stomach, the flesh was digested, while bones, fur, feathers, and insect shells were churned into pellets and regurgitated; these tended to indicate an owlbear lair was close by.[13] The scent of flesh that emanated from an owlbear's lair often attracted scavengers and, therefore, more prey, though it acted as a warning to other creatures.[3][1] The sole exception to their carnivorous diet was a liking for honey, which they inherited from regular bears. They could lap it up with their thick tongues and their thick coats protected them from angry bees. A jar of honey was effective bait for owlbear hunters.[13] An owlbear naturally had a bear's keen sense of scent that it could use to track prey[4][1] as well as an owl's sharp eyesight for finding prey in the dark,[2][3][1] with specimens even reported to possess low-light vision,[2] infravision,[13] or darkvision.[3][1] They also had acute hearing able to locate a sound with pinpoint accuracy. As a result, it was nigh impossible to sneak past an owlbear, let alone sneak up on one, and they were not hampered by complete darkness or against invisible foes. Their nictitating membranes also protected their sensitive eyes from blinding lights.[13] Despite their unnatural origins, owlbears possessed no supernatural powers, though their calls were magical in nature. Different subspecies of owlbear had different calls, and these could have different magical effects.[3] A strongheart halfling preventing an attack by an owlbear by blocking its beak. An owlbear fought with both its beak and its claws. They would try to slash and grab prey with one or both their claws, crush it in a bear-hug, and bite it and rend it in twain.[7][8][6][4][2][3][1][13] While in a bear-hug, an owlbear often could not use its claws, and so favored biting with its beak and using its brute strength to crush its victim.[13] In a fight, they simply targeted whatever was closest.[2] If wounded in a fight, they were known to screech so loudly it stunned nearby creatures, which the owlbear would then seize advantage of.[2][3] Even at the point of death, an owlbear would fight as vigorously as it would when healthy.[13] Owlbears were poor at climbing trees, owing to their large size and weight. But a victim who fled up a tree was not necessarily in the clear\u2014the owlbear would simply wait under the tree or even knock it over if possible.[13] Living in temperate climes and forested areas, owlbears established their lairs in tangled woods, in near-surface caves, and within large hollow trees and stumps, and in ruined structures. These lairs soon became littered with broken bones and gizzards,[8][4][2][3][1] and the treasures of its victims, for those who dared look.[6] Their favored hunting grounds were often dense wooded areas that they were familiar with and that prey could not escape through.[3][1] A mated pair had a territory of 1 to 2\u202fsquare miles (2.6 to 5.2\u202fsquare kilometers), and would of course fiercely defend it against trespassers.[6] They clawed at certain trees, leaving vertical grooves, to both mark territory and sharpen claws.[13] An owlbear chick. No matter how big a pair of eyes it gives you, it will claw yours out. In mating season, owlbear females entered estrus while males became hormonal and produced musk.[18] Although warm-blooded mammalian creatures, owlbears laid eggs.[8] Almost spherical, they laid as many as six eggs in each clutch and several days apart.[13] Young owlbears were called chicks[19] or cubs.[13] Adult owlbears dwelled together as mated pairs, and had up to six chicks at a time, which they kept in their lairs while they went hunting.[8][6][4][2] Despite this, owlbear chicks were still relatively dangerous.[8][6][3] Owlbear mothers did not produce milk and cubs were as carnivorous as adults, so adults brought them fresh meat. The mothers reared and trained the cubs in hunting until they were about two years old, when they were able to hunt on their own.[13] Mated owlbears usually separated when the young were old enough to hunt, but if prey was readily available, a family could stay together for longer periods.[3][1] Once old enough, cubs left to establish their own territory.[13] They lived up to 20 years.[6] When out hunting, as they always were, owlbears could be encountered alone, in mated pairs, or in packs of up to five or even eight.[8][6][4][3][1] Although a beast of unnatural origin, the owlbear was a fully formed species that occupied the same niche as other predators.[3] A few creatures did prey on owlbears, with the aratha, or 'killer beetle', favoring owlbear meat.[20] The owlbears of the starwood area of Cormanthor developed a unique approach to finding food: farming insects. They had quickly eaten through their food supply of wolves, rabbits, and snakes, and as food became scarce, their population began to decrease. Then, in the late 1350s DR, while hunting in the central starwood, one pack came across a pit holding a felled, rotting oak tree infested by giant harvester termites, which they threw rocks at, picked out with sticks, and ate, finding that they were edible and tasty albeit not very filling. They returned a month later, finding thousands of termite larvae. The owlbears threw in additional decayed branches and damp leaves, watched the termite larvae eat the wood, and then ate them by the handful. Over some tendays of this, the owlbears learned how to grow and maintain the termite colony by managing the wood supply and therefore effectively grew their own food. They did however have to kill the fire-spitting soldier termites the moment they hatched.[21] In time, the owlbears even established new termite colonies by digging pits and stocking them with wood and adult harvester termites. Other packs acquired the skill and before long the whole owlbear population of the starwood was farming termites. The owlbears favored crushing adult termites, eaten their soft insides, and throwing the shells. As a coincidental side effect of this practice, horses were strongly attracted to the scent of decaying termite shells mixed with owlbear saliva. The owlbears took to hiding and waiting for horses to arrive, before pushing them into a termite pit and then devouring them, and any riders they happened to have. These new food sources arrested their decline and their numbers were steadily growing again by 1367 DR.[21] Pyrolisks were also drawn to the termite pits, but even owlbears would abandon a pit if a pyrolisk turned up, rather than be incinerated, however begrudgingly. The pyrolisks used the pits as their nests and their hatchlings fed on the termite larvae.[21] A brutish owlbear from the Savage Frontier. In the North, Silver Marches, and Savage Frontier, owlbears remained quite common.[22] They inhabited the Southwood, Ardeep Forest,[23][24] Far Forest,[25][26] High Forest,[27][28] and Misty Forest. These Misty Forest owlbears hunted at night[29][30] and sometimes roamed up to the western edge of the High Moor, before quickly being driven by the local predators.[31] They were also rumored to be found in the Westwood[32][33] and could be encountered in the Dessarin Valley,[34] Delimbiyr Vale, and Laughing Hollow.[35] Owlbears were common in the agricultural heart of Amn[36] and in the Forest of Tethir in Tethyr.[37] In the Moonshae Isles, owlbears were found in the realm of Corwell on the island of Gwynneth in the late 1400s DR.[38] Around the Moonsea, they were found in the Dragonspine Mountains. Further south, they were around the Dalelands,[39] in the Desertsmouth Mountains,[40] in the forests of Shadowdale,[41] Daggerdale in the Dagger Hills,[42][43][44] and Deepingdale,[45] and in the Arch Wood between Archendale and Tasseldale.[46][47] They occasionally also hunted in Battledale around the Three Rivers.[48][49] In the great forest of Cormanthor, owlbears were found in the starwood area and[50] in the Elvenwood.[51] During the time of ancient Netheril, owlbears were to be found in the Eastern Forest (later the Border Forest).[52] Between Impiltur and the Vast, they were found in the Gray Forest.[53] Further east, in Rashemen, owlbears lived in the Ashenwood and Erech Forest and hunted along the shores of Lake Ashane.[54][55][56][57] In Aglarond, owlbears could be found along the coast in the uplands, rather than the Yuirwood itself.[58] Chessenta saw the occasional owlbear from the deep forests in the late 1400s.[59] In the south, owlbears were endemic to the Forest of Amtar[60] and the Toadsquat Mountains.[61] In the Border Kingdoms, they dwelled in the Duskwood, the Qurth Forest, and the ravines north of Bloutar.[62][63][64][65] Far to the south, owlbears were found on the island of Nimbral.[66] Owlbears had also been found in notable dungeons, including the vast dungeon of Undermountain, with encounters in the Arcane Chambers,[67][68] Crystal Labyrinth,[69] and Wyllowwood.[70][71] The entrance to the Haunted Halls of Eveningstar in Cormyr was found to be the lair of an owlbear circa 1360 DR.[72] Two owlbears wandered into Under Elmwood and laired there circa 1367 DR.[73] Remember: an owlbear is for life, not just for Midsummer. An owlbear egg could be sold for 200 to 2,000 gp and a hatchling or young owlbear could be sold for 500 to 3,000\u20135,000 gp in civilized places where the market existed for them.[8][6][4][19][74][75][76] Wizards were the main buyers, for use as guardian creatures.[6] Owlbear eggs were among the exotic goods transported in royal-scale caravans crossing the Hordelands to Kara-Tur.[77] An owlbear pelt would go for 5 gp[75][78] and 20 gp if properly trimmed. An owlbear fur cape or jacket was worth 200 gp and a coat, robe, or blanket was worth 400 gp.[78] Owlbear leather was a quality material used in the crafting of armor and in reinforcing weapons.[79] Owlbear bone was sturdy and durable; it was used in the pommels of Arthane longswords.[80] Owlbear feathers were made for quality spell components.[81] Owlbear musk was extracted from hormonal males in mating season. It was so potent that one whiff was enough to free a creature of enchantments that dazed, stunned, or dominated the mind. A typical pouch contained enough for three uses, weighed 1\u202fpound (450\u202fgrams), and was valued at 500 gp. Centaurs were especially skilled in trapping these owlbears and quickly extracting the musk glands.[18] An owlbear being tamed for the City Watch of Waterdeep. Don't feel sorry for it. Owlbears were impossible to domesticate and very difficult to tame, but they could be charmed or trained to a degree,[6][4][2][3][1][19] through food (raw meat was preferred[19]), patience, and, above all, good luck.[3][1] While magic might briefly make an owlbear docile and receptive to training, it forgot everything it learned when the spell expired. But the most common training method was pain, particularly to have an owlbear serve as a mount. Although widely regarded by good folk as cruel for owlbear and trainer alike, repeated heavy beatings were used to discourage the owlbear from attacking its trainer and later a rider. This method was the one most often shown to work, but no matter how light or how heavy, how little or how often the beatings, these owlbears held deep hatred for their trainers and riders and turned on them at the first sign of weakness.[74] Professional trainers demanded 2,000 gp to rear or train one owlbear.[4][19][74] A rare few individuals were 'owlbear whisperers', who could somehow placate an owlbear and even persuade it to follow them as a companion or guardian, at least so long as it was fed.[82] Whatever method was used, an owlbear could learn to know and obey a master and serve as a guardian or mount.[19][74][3][1] One raised from a chick could become quite loyal to a trainer, but to anyone else they would remain surly at best.[19] Owlbears did not need to be trained to attack, as they did that regardless, and they were considered not much good for other tasks, which they performed quite begrudgingly. If ordered not to attack, they could well ignore their master and attack anyway.[19] They could protect a master to a point, by attacking those who attacked their masters, and they could be trained to make even louder, thunderous shrieks that could bowl enemies over[3] or distinct alert noises when fighting non-owlbears.[19] Trained owlbears were typically used as free-ranging guardians in enclosed or strategic areas, which they saw as their territory. They tirelessly chased after all trespassers[6][4][19][2] and fresh meat would be thrown to them as needed.[19] Owlbear guardians were described as like 'keep out' signs but not as subtle. Owlbears found in ruins or dungeons had most likely been placed there as guardians.[6] Gray orc tribes kept such creatures as owlbears as tribal guardians.[83] Brave and foolish. Owlbear mounts were ridden only by the brave, the foolish, or both. As such owlbears had often been beaten, they would struggle against their riders when they saw them seriously injured or weakened in battle, try to throw the rider out of the saddle, and then savage them with no thought for any other foe. Only a highly skilled rider can keep control of an owlbear.[74] Elven treetop communities could sometimes encouraged owlbears to lair under their homes, so that they served as a defense at night. Hobgoblins might employ them as war beasts and hill giants and frost giants would have them as pets. In some frontier lands, owlbears might be trained for racing, with bets made on both which would win and which would savage its handler. Some gladiatorial arenas could keep starved owlbears for especially savage opponents,[3][1] such as the Arena of Zhentil Keep.[84] The Eldreth Veluuthra were known to lure owlbears to border regions to assault human settlements.[85] The banshee Agatha charmed owlbears to build traps around her grove.[86][87] A druid circa 1479 DR with a primal aspect could adopt the semblance of an owlbear for their wildshape, as they could many other creatures, though this was no true transformation.[88] Prior to that, after the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, a druid could not wildshape into an owlbear, it being a magical beast rather than a thing of nature.[89][90] Incarnum-using totemists could bind an owlbear avatar to their arms to gain their grappling power.[91] An owlbear could be summoned with the monster summoning IV spell[92][93] or summon nature's ally V.[94] One could summon an undead owlbear skeleton with summon undead II.[95][96] With the find minion spell, a wizard could have a loyal owlbear minion. It would not fight to the death, unless commanded or to protect its master. They would not lay eggs, but would hibernate in winter if the climate called for it. Uniquely, an owlbear minion could transform into a regular bear or giant owl once a day for a couple of hours. The wizard master grew a crest of yellow-brown hair not unlike an owlbear's.[97] The god Malar, Lord of Beasts, favored acting through owlbears and other predatory beasts. The Beast Lords that served him were known to breed owlbears and other monsters. Malarite Huntmasters would try to slay such predators as owlbears as their god's avatar did, and would wear their pelts and their heads as headdresses.[98][99][100] Tapann, the god of the korreds, was said to wear a rough tunic made from the hide of a bear or owlbear.[101] A pair of owlbear-hunters become the owlbear-hunted. Among other savage predatory beasts and monsters, owlbears were a common target of hunters. Rashemaar nobles enjoyed hunting them[102] and young Uthgardt would try to build a reputation by taking one down.[103] The Hunt Lords at Noanar's Hold fed dead owlbears and other creatures to their captive deepspawn, which bred clones for hunters to pursue in the High Forest.[104][105] Guides at the Whistling Stag inn and hunting lodge in Quaervarr led hunters to owlbears and more in the Moonwood.[106][107][108] Owlbears were favored as hunting trophies, with stuffed owlbears,[109][110] owlbear-fur rugs and blankets,[111][112][113][114] and mounted heads displayed in some estates, halls, and villas.[115][116][117] Owlbear pelts adorned the walls and floors of the Trailswatch inn in Gray Oaks and the Blushing Maiden in Dhedluk, Cormyr.[118] Although owlbear females did not produce milk,[13] owlbear milk was reputed to be smooth and sweet.[119] Owlbear Stew, a specialty of the Beer Golem Tavern in Waterdeep, in fact contained no owlbear, only beef and sausages and a lot of spices.[120] 'Genuine' owlbear meat was served as a main course at the The Boar With Black Tusks in Noanar's Hold.[121] How the owlbear came to be was a long-running argument among scholars. The mostly widely held theory was of course that the first owlbear was the product of a demented mage crossing a bear and a giant owl.[8][6][4][1] The goal was likely to combine the bear's strength, stamina, and claws and the owl's keen senses, but the experiment was likely a failure, given how bad-tempered and untrainable it would've been.[122] In any case, the mage was most likely killed by it too.[6] Some accounts rejected this notion, but still could not explain them.[3] The oldest elves recalled that owlbears had been around for many millennia and a few fey claimed owlbears had always been found in the Feywild.[1] If this was correct, owlbears had originated as Feywild predators before somehow finding their way into the material world in ancient times.[2] In the wake of the Time of Troubles, a new theory was put forward that such creatures as owlbears and perytons were abominations created in past godswars that survived and bred true.[123] In fact, on Toril, at least, owlbears were brought into being by one of the creator races,[124] most likely the aearee.[speculation][note 1] The enemy. During the Silver Age of Netheril, Netherese human colonists led by the Terraseer eradicated the 3,000-strong population of owlbears of the Savage Frontier so they could not trouble their caravans, in the so-called Caravan War in 1491 NY (\u22122368 DR). They established the Old Owl Well outpost there and named it for the owlbears,[124] originally Old Owlbear Well.[125] They left behind mass graves of owlbear carcasses; the Netherese wizard Sysquemalyn tormented Sunbright Steelshanks with a vision of one of these and his death in the beak of a zombie owlbear.[126] Owlbears would return to the area by the 14th century, however.[127] At the beginning of the human settlement near Cormanthor, in the Year of Leather Shields, \u221275 DR, the Netherese wizard Baerauble Etharr suggested to Alea Dahast that the elves stock the fringes of the forest with owlbears and other dangerous beasts, to discourage human woodsmen venturing into the elven-inhabited interior. She would take the idea back to Lord Iliphar.[128] In the Year of the Firestars, 6 DR, one of those humans, Ondeth Obarskyr (founder of the settlement that would become Cormyr) joined an elven hunt that sought a giant owlbear. He impressed the elves by lending his arm in the fight, before Alea would take it down. It was believed to be among the last giant owlbears in the area[129] and indeed they were long extinct there by 900 DR.[130] King Errilam I of Tethyr was killed in a hunting accident while pursing an owlbear in the 1277 DR, though it was rumored his elven companions were responsible.[131] Bhaal, the Lord of Murder, created a powerful owlbear named Thorax and other creatures as his 'children' in mockery of the Earthmother's Children in order to terrorize the Moonshae Isles in the Year of the Saddle, 1345 DR.[132][133][134] Owlbears were known to inhabit the Yuirwood of Aglarond in ancient times. Although once common there, human settlement and woodcutting from 756 DR onward brought them and other creatures into conflict, adventurers hunted the most fierce, and owlbears were little more than legend by the mid-1300s DR.[135][136] However, owlbears and other monsters were reportedly becoming more common again by Tarsakh of the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR. (In fact, they were minions of Gombdalla of Thay.)[137][138] By Ches of 1357 DR, rumors spread about the rise of a new Beast Lord in the North who used magic to command monstrous creatures such as owlbears and unleash them on the land.[139] When the Rashemi and the Tuigan fought the Battle of the Lake of Tears in the Year of the Turret, 1360 DR, the Hathrans sent owlbears and winter wolves against the invaders.[140] In the late 1400s DR, a dragonborn follower of Tiamat named Jeralla stole a trained owlbear from an elf druid of the Quivering Forest. She used it in her raids in the Year of Dwarvenkind Reborn, 1488 DR; while it only begrudgingly obeyed her, she could bring it to heel with an Elven word, Arael'sha. The druid desired the owlbear's safe return.[141] The following subspecies and variations were known to exist in the Realms: In the Calendar of Harptos, 477 DR was called \"The Year of the Owlbear\". Waterdhavian merchant-adventurer Essimuth Lanys owned a pegleg carved to resemble an owlbear supporting him on its arms and shoulders.[157] This commemorated the eye and leg he lost to an owlbear attack.[158] The Owlbear Berserker Lodge of Rashemen took the owlbear as their totem beast their grappling fighting style was inspired by it.[159][160] Stuffed owlbear toys for children were common in Waterdeep in the 1490s DR; the Waterdhavian street urchin Jenks owned one.[161][162] The owlbear is one of the oldest and most original monsters of Dungeons & Dragons, having first appeared as 'Owl Bears' in the 1975 Greyhawk supplement for original-edition D&D. Gary Gygax based many of these early monsters on small plastic monster figurines nicknamed 'patchisaurs', which he had used in place of miniatures. The owlbear was based on a beaked, tailed, and scaled/feathered yellow monster, as recounted by Timothy J. Kask and Tony DiTerlizzi, seen here. However, what this monster actually represents is ambiguous. In research compiled by En World here, many patchisaurs and hence some D&D monsters originated in kaiju appearing in Ultraman, so the characters Gomora, Bemstar, and others have been proposed, but these seem inconclusive. A more likely possibility is the figurine is based on the kappa of Japanese folklore. If so, the figurine should be seen as reptilian rather than owl or bear\u2014neither of which has a long tail. While the owlbear drawn by David C. Sutherland III in the 1977 1st-edition Monster Manual closely followed the design of the yellow patchisaur, the owlbear drawn by Greg Bell in Greyhawk two years earlier is a much more conventional bear with an owl's head, as the owlbear would be commonly depicted in the future, albeit with a long tail.",

Panthers which were warped by the magical energies of the Feywild and Shadowfell could become fey panthers and spectral panthers respectively.

        "description": "      Pegasi, at first glance, resembled mere horses with large bird-like wings. Despite this, they had other avian features as well: their lower legs were feathered instead of furred and their manes and tails were also of feathers.[3][5] Being wild and shy magical creatures, pegasi were not easily tamed and ridden. A pegasus would serve as an aerial steed only to a good-natured humanoid. In any cases they will strongly be opposed to wear saddle. The most common way they were trained was after being raised from birth though sometimes a grown pegasus might be tamed, with a friendly attitude to the tamer, making a worthy steed indeed.[3] Once tamed, a pegasus formed a bond with their rider, obeying their commands. If the rider became evil after it tamed a pegasus, the pegasus rejected them.[3] A pegasus acting as a mount for a Paladin. Being goodly creatures, they would only serve good causes and riders, with an absolute faithfulness for life. But it is excluded that they join neutral and evil character.[5] In combat, pegasi used their hooves and teeth as weapons. A common tactic was striking a target from above. The pegasus dove at a target from a height of up to 50\u202fft (15\u202fm) and delivered a devastating attack with their hooves. If facing an opponent larger then they were, pegasi lured them into a confining space, where the larger opponents size was at a disadvantage. This was a common pegais tactic against dragons. Pegasi preferred to avoid combat if they could, instead using their speed and agility to lead their opponent on a chase, tiring them out.[3] If the nest of a pegasi couple was attacked, one of them would defend the young while the other one attacked the invader, striking at them to get their attention. The goal was to enrage the opponent and lure them away from the nest. The pegasus lured them as far away from the nest as possible.[3] Pegasi had the innate ability to duplicate the effects of detect evil and detect good spells at will. This was used by the pegasus to detect the alignment of a potential rider.[3] Pegasi were social creatures, living in herds. Herds were sometimes led by a greater pegasus.[3] Many pegasi revered the gods Eachthighern and Lurue. On Evermeet, their queen was Yathaghera.[6] While pegasi considered all evil creatures vile, they harboured a particular hate for griffons and hippogriffs.[3] Pegasi were used by the Seldarine as mounts.[1] Pegasi most commonly lived in temperate or warm forests.[3] A pegasus and its foal. Pegasi were hebivores. Their diet mainly consisted of fruits and plants.[3] Along with their physical attributes, pegasi were also like birds in that they laid eggs[note 1] rather than giving birth to live young.[3] Pegasi laid eggs in nests high in the mountains, where only flying creatures can reach. A pegasus would mature at the same rate as a horse, however, and had somewhat similar habits.[2] A pegasi couple mated for life.[1] The origins of the pegasi could be traced back to the plane of Arborea.[1] Pegasi eggs are incredibly valuable on the market. A single egg could fetch up to 3,000 sp. Young pegasi were usually sold at a price of 5,000 sp each.[3] Greater pegasi looked like regular pegasi but were stronger and had a natural resistance to magic. It was thought that greater pegasi were born when a medusa was decapitated. As this only happened rarely, greater pegasi were far rarer than regular pegasi.[3] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

It looked for a likely spot in the Ethereal Plane, and then teleported (its form of teleportation was known as \"phasing,\" hence the name) to the Material Plane, presumably ambushing travelers it expected to be there, biting and killing them, and then quickly retreating back to the Ethereal Plane.[3] They could not speak. They were regarded as neutral in alignment.[3] In the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, a small group of drow arachnomancers took over one of ancient Illefarn ruins, interestingly enough, located in the deep jungles of Samarach of the Chultan Peninsula.

        "description": "      Pit fiends were both majestic and horrifying, with a hulking 12\u2011foot-tall (3.7\u2011meter) humanoid form that weighed 800\u202fpounds (360\u202fkilograms)[3][7] Their bodies were armored with scales and were quickly inflamed in response to their rage or excitement. A pair of massive, bat-like wings gave pit fiends a gargoylish appearance and they often wrapped their wings around their fearsome, red figures. Their huge fangs dripped with hissing, green venom and their prehensile tails could be cracked like whips.[3][8] After rising from the Pit of Flame, pit fiends had obtained a perfect understanding of their nature as devils.[6] Their spirits had been completely purged of impurity, for they had willfully chosen to reject chaos in its entirety.[9] They were both self-entitled narcissists and tyrannical masterminds that schemed to bring their dark agendas to fruition and ruthlessly pursued their inscrutable desires.[1][6] Within the depths of their enigmatic minds was a vast, manipulative intelligence and a unique understanding of agony.[1][6][7] Every part of a pit fiend could be used as a weapon: their fearsome claws, their powerful wings, constricting tails, and menacing maws.[8] The bite of a pit fiend was both venomous and infectious, inflicting a wicked disease known as devil chills and filling the victim with vile poisons. The combined effect drained the victim's vitality and strength, rendering them powerless against the brutality of the pit fiend.[7] As easily as they could envelop themselves in an aura of sheer terror, they could ignite their own bodies to burn anyone too close.[2] Their scale armor and regenerative abilities made them incredibly durable, and good-aligned spells and weapons, or silvered weapons were the most effective means of stopping their natural healing.[7] The magical abilities of the pit fiends were largely based around their ability to create and manipulate flames, often with truly devastating force.[1][3] Their magic also allowed them to paralyze powerful beings, turn themselves invisible and use a symbol of pain to cripple their enemies. They could easily gate in a few baatezu from all ranks, from the lowliest of lemures to fellow pit fiends, although the more powerful the type of devil the fewer they could call.[3][8] The most dangerous of their magical powers however, was their ability to cast the wish spell once each year.[8] A pit fiend fighting off a balor. Pit fiends could surpass their already mountainous power by training, and those that chose to learn magic could be truly devastating forces of destruction. Not only did pit fiend mages often specialize in evocation magic, but the only limit to their magical power and expertise was time, a particularly frightening notion given their immortality.[10] But while their monstrous forms and array of magical abilities made them formidable foes, the greatest weapon in the arsenal of a pit fiend was potentially their minds. Through ingenious planning, fearsome guile, and creative tactics, pit fiends could win battles even without their power and magic.[3][7] Pit fiends normally began battle by enveloping themselves in their auras and summoning other devils for assistance, often attempting to get them into flanking position. From there, they used their magical abilities to rain down hellish infernos upon enemy groups, striking fear into the hearts of their foes and magically restricting those without armor, especially in regards to irritating spellcasters.[2][3] They viciously destroyed those they saw as most weakened by their initial onslaught. In addition to their claws, they were known to arm themselves with jagged-toothed clubs, ancus-like weapons, and burning maces.[2][5] Their other strategies involved turning themselves invisible while savaging those most capable of perceiving them.[3] If put in a dangerous position, they would maneuver the battlefield as needed and would not hesitate to sacrifice devils weaker than themselves.[2][3] The only mental shortcoming of the pit fiends was their complete and utter hubris. Incapable of considering the possibility of failure, they often sought out the most powerful enemies first with dauntless intent to prove their indomitable greatness.[1][3] Pit fiends formed the terrifying nobility of the Nine Hells and stood undisputed as the greatest of the non-unique baatezu. They were the elite overseers of practically all other devils, and experts in fostering terror in both mortals and devils.[2][7] The pit fiends had proven themselves to have the subtlety and brutality to eliminate pretenders to their thrones of purity.[9] Despite all this, the prestigious rank of pit fiend was still highly dangerous, as they had to navigate Hell's convoluted rules and treacherous political landscape while still contending with the heavy responsibilities that came with their station as the servants of Baator's true masters.[1][2] A pit fiend passing judgement. The only beings that all pit fiends were subservient to were the dukes, duchesses, and archdevils of Hell, fulfilling their wills and sometimes serving as seneschals or counselors. Every pit fiend acted as a vassal for an archdevil and controlled a large domain within their lands, whether in the form of a fortress commander, city governor, or general of a legion.[2] As his personal servants, Asmodeus was the only archdevil that possessed a retinue of over twelve pit fiends.[2][4] When within Baator, they were always in positions of power, commanding legions of lesser devils, judging mortals, and controlling territory, rarely found without an entourage of slaves and weaker devils nearby.[2][11] Even outside of Hell, the might of the baatezu followed the pit fiends, as they led dozens of devastating armies against the tanar'ri. The dread that their legions wrought in mortals was enough to make most flee for days on end to escape them on sight.[8] They were not above acts of corruption and had the authority to entice mortals with Faustian bargains.[1][11] Pit fiends were often too busy with their personal plots and numerous duties to be bothered with mortal adventurers, only intervening in affairs when their plans were seriously jeopardized or at the cusp of victory.[2] Pit fiends were rarest on the upper levels with the exception of Avernus, particularly avoided the colder layers of Hell and could be found in great quantities within Nessus.[4][12] Pit fiends were made from worthy gelugons or erinyes who were subjected to the devil-scorching hellfire from the Pit of Flame for 1,001 days.[6] Pit fiends were allowed to choose their sex after exiting the Pit of Flame, but changing it again required them to re-enter it for three more days.[13] However, another way to create pit fiends was through the blood of Asmodeus himself as each drop would become a greater devil, most often a pit fiend. Such beings were imparted with fanatical loyalty towards their creator and pit fiends created this way could themselves spawn lesser devils, normally barbazus, by shedding blood. Through this bloodletting process, Asmodeus filled his layer of Hell with endless hordes of pit fiends.[14] Only the greatest pit fiends were promoted beyond the ranks of normal baatezu, the chosen few that were transformed by an archduke into a duke, a unique form of devil with its own special abilities.[15] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.

        "description": " This is a\nGood Article!   Planetars were known to be in service to the deities Deneir and Ilmater.[10]    A planetar usually appeared as a handsome, powerful, and muscular humanoid creature[2][5][6] with opalescent[1][5][6] emerald skin.[3][4][1][2] They had opalescent[5][6] white-feathered wings,[3][4][1][2] stood between about 8[3][4] and 9 feet[2] (2.4 to 2.7 meters) tall, and weighed about 500 pounds (230 kilograms).[2] They were typically bald.[3][4][2][5][6] Not all planetars appeared like this, however. For example, the Shards, the planetars in service to Sel\u00fbne had long, flowing blue hair and pearly white skin.[11][12][13][14] In addition to the magical powers common to all angels, planetars could pray for and cast divine magical spells like the most powerful of clerics.[3][4][2][5][6] Beyond this, they had innate access to a wide range of powerful magics, for which they did not need to pray. These included but were not limited to the ability to restore victims from ailments and raise the dead.[3][4][1][2][5][6] They could create a barrier of magical blades,[3][4][1][2][5][6] trigger a massive earthquake,[3][4][2][5][6] send waves of exhaustion over their enemies,[2] charm large groups of monsters at the same time,[2] call down a column of divine fire,[3][4][1][2][5][6] and stun with only a single word.[2] Several times per day they could transform themselves into nearly any creature or object.[3][4][2][5][6] They could commune directly with their deity.[3][4][1][5][6] Whenever they desired, they could create a continual flame of light;[2][5][6] turn invisible;[1][2][5][6] smite fiends with a burst of holy power;[2] remove curses,[3][4][1][2][5][6] diseases,[1][2] and fear;[3][4][2][5][6] dispel magic;[3][4][2][5][6] and even speak with the dead.[3][4][2][5][6] Planetars had control over weather[3][4][1][5][6] and could call down rain to quench a thirsty field or a plague of locusts to punish the wicked.[3][4][1][5][6] A planetar in flight. They bore all of the immunities and resistances of other angels and were surrounded by the same protective aura of good.[2][5][6] Furthermore, they could only be permanently harmed by magically evil attacks;[3][4][2][5][6] they could regenerate from any other injuries.[3][4][2][5][6] Planetars could see in the dark and in low-light,[2][5][6] and they always saw things as they truly were,[3][1][2][5][6] being able to see invisible and shapechanged creatures and objects,[3][1][2][5][6] hidden traps,[2][5][6] and evil auras.[1][2][5][6] They could even into the ultraviolet spectrum to a visual range of 200\u202fyards (180\u202fmeters).[15] They could always sense when someone was lying.[1][2][5][6] The great wings of planetars allowed them to fly at great speeds with excellent maneuverability in the air.[3][4][1][2] Planetars, like all other angels, could use magic to speak any language.[2][5][6] They could also communicate telepathically within 100 feet (30 meters).[3][4][1][5][6] As with other aasimon, planetars could not be permanently slain unless on their home plane. If their bodies were destroyed anywhere else, their life forces would return to their home plane, where their bodies would reform over a period of 40 years.[3][4][5][6] A planetar slaying a fiend. All planetars were good. Their particular ethical bent depended on the deity that they served.[5][6] Planetars gave off a sense of strength and confidence.[3][4] They inspired goodness in others by the power of their deeds, not their words.[8] Planetars loved battling fiends[1] and slew every truly evil creature set in their path.[2] Despite their vast array of magical powers, planetars were more likely to wade into melee with their powerful, two-handed[3][4] greatswords[1][2] or bastard swords[5][6][16]\u2014especially with swords known as celestial blades, which glowed with radiant light and were engraved with the holy symbol of the deity that the planetar served.[16] It was said that only a planetar could wield such a sword,[3][4][5][6] which damaged enemies with holy radiance.[1] Planetars, who numbered more than a hundred,[5][6] were found on the slopes of Mount Celestia, on the pastoral fields of Bytopia, in the forests of the Beastlands,[17] and on other Upper Planes.[2][7] As celestial stewards, planetars directly served the good deities.[3][4] One or a few served as the right hand of a minor deity, while larger numbers served the major deities.[5][6] They were only sent to other planes to aid the most powerful and faithful of their deities' servants.[3][4] Only the most perilous of missions were assigned to them, such as rescuing a mortal cleric from the grips of a pit fiend or recovering a stolen artifact from the lair of an arcanaloth.[8] On such missions, they usually acted alone.[8] A planetar succeeding at a mission had a small chance of being promoted to the status of a solar.[8] The planetar known as Resounding Justice sacrificed herself to save the city of Archenbridge in the Dalelands. As outsiders, planetars were not dependent upon their environment for survival.[3][4] On rare occasions where a planetar would take a mortal lover\u2014which was known to have occurred in particular with some of Sel\u00fbne's Shards[18]\u2014his or her aasimar descendants would often have emerald skin or the traces of white feathers at the shoulder, as evidence of the celestial heritage.[19]",

Its white coat also gave it an advantage when hunting in snowy areas.[2] When a polar bear attacked, it primarily used its powerful claws, tearing at its prey, as well as its bite.[1] It would also pull its opponents into a grapple.[2] Polar bears heavily populated the region of Nakalpgotak on the Great Glacier.[6] They preyed upon many animals, including even those as large as ghost roth\u00e9.[7] Polar bear meat was barely edible to most people. It was tough and stringy and hard to digest.[8] The Iulutiuns ate polar bear meat[8][9] and used its fur for clothing.[10] Likewise, Nakulutiuns consumed polar bear meat,[11] as did the Ice Hunters of the Sea of Moving Ice.[12] Among non-humans, the Innugaakalikurit wore polar bear fur as well.[13][14] White dragons[15] and tirichik[13] also preyed upon polar bears. Polar bear bone was carvable.[16] Polar bears were important in the culture of the Iulutiuns of the Great Glacier, where a child's first polar bear kill was celebrated with a ritual known as the nukiewquak, in which the bear's head was kept on a pole outside the family house for many days.[9] The first polar bear kill of the year was also celebrated.[17] Polar bears were associated with the virtue of courage within the Iulutiun culture.[17] Powerful druids and rangers sometimes had polar bears as companions.[18] The famous wise man of the Iulutiuns, Inum, had been crippled by a polar bear.[19] Heafstaag, king of the Tribe of the Elk of Icewind Dale had had his hand mauled by a polar bear.[20]",

        "description": "   Perhaps the best known \u2014 and most infamous \u2014 cleric on Toril was Fzoul Chembryl before his ascension to godhood. Other well-known clerics were Cadderly Bonaduce, a Chosen of Deneir, and Qilue Veladorn, one of the Seven Sisters and a cleric of Eilistraee.    Religion was deeply important to the majority of people on Toril, who felt that the gods were a very real and active presence in their lives, something that was not very far from the truth. For this reason, serving the gods was something that most people did as just a regular part of their lives.[15] Clerics were elite agents of gods, empowered beyond the capabilities of regular priests[13] and sworn to follow and obey the tenets of their religion in ways that the average mortal couldn't.[16] Some clerics served primordials or even fiends, offering foul sacrifices in exchange for a portion of the fiend's might,[17][18] but the majority remained servants of the truly divine. Clerics had to be close to the alignment of their patron, usually within one step of the deity's alignment or less.[19] Gods were as varying as people and, as a result, so were their divine agents, such as clerics, who might be good or evil, lawful or chaotic, dependent on who they worshiped and why. Good clerics healed and protected, helping those in need while evil clerics terrorized and destroyed, increasing the power of their deity and themselves. Generally, non-evil clerics were more common, since good or neutral deities tended to attract more worshipers than evil ones did. However, some evil gods, such as Bane, were popular in their own right, with a large legion of followers and clerics willing to do their bidding. Similarly, though many clerics belonged to orderly and structured churches, chaotic gods had clerical servants as well.[20] Relatively few priests became wandering clerics, leaving for adventure only if they felt compelled to do so for their god,[21] perhaps out of a desire to spread their deity's works or by order of their superiors and the church hierarchy. A few clerics took on the adventuring lifestyle for more mundane reasons.[20] Regardless of motivation, clerics were highly valued companions, serving as healers and occasional leaders to their compatriots. Additionally, clerics may have been specialized in ways, based on the deity they worship, that put them on agreeable terms with other adventurers.[22] The most active clerics were typically humans or dwarves, though half-elven, elven, and dragonborn clerics were also relatively common.[23] Nearly all clerics were ordained members of a religious organization of some kind, though a few operated more independently and even those who were bound to a hierarchy did not necessarily answer to a direct superior. Most clerics made their career choice relatively early in life, though some were compelled to service unwillingly by their god.[24] Churches were often, but not always, tied to a specific god, though few gods presided over more than one church at once, some of which warred with one another over differing interpretations of their god's (or pantheon's) dogma.[22] A cleric's holy symbol could be used to control or even destroy the undead. Clerics commonly used light or medium armor, shields, simple weapons, and divine magic as their chief tools while adventuring.[24] Many clerics were also skilled in the use of heavy armor.[25] Clerics augmented these spells, also known as \"prayers,\"[19] through holy symbols of their deity that they wore or carried with them.[26] Clerics were also experts in casting rituals, enhanced spells that require an incredible amount of time and preparation to use but which often had dramatic effects.[26] Others might instead have chosen to be trained in preparing alchemical recipes.[27] Clerics could also learn to directly access the channel the divinity of their deity through their body.[28] This power manifested itself in several ways, the most common of which was the ability to turn undead, repelling or even destroying the undead.[28] A few clerics learned instead to control the undead, particularly those of an evil nature.[25] Some clerics may have learned to channel divinity based on their domain[26] or the nature of the deity they worshiped.[29] Clerics of Mielikki and Sune, for example, had access to wildly different ways to channel their deity's divinity.[30] Sufficiently experienced clerics could even invoke their deity's intervention directly, without using Channel Divinity. If successfully petitioned, the deity's aid could come in one of several forms, from a spell to something more unusual. Such calls for aid, however, were difficult to make and the gods were disinclined to respond much more often than once a tenday.[31] Some clerics were powerful healers thanks to special training and the blessings of their gods, both of which increased the potency of the curative prayers available to them. Many clerics were capable of casting the healing word prayer, while more experienced clerics were often capable of much more.[32] Some clerics were also trained in transforming other prayers into powers of healing or, if the cleric worshiped a non-good god, into spells of necrotic power.[33] Some clerics had additional abilities less common among their compatriots. Several clerics learned, in addition to the gentle repose ritual known to many of them, the ritual of Simbul's conversion, which allowed a cleric to convert their prayers into healing energy. A fewer number of clerics, generally evil in alignment, learned instead to convert this stored energy into negative energy for the purpose of harming enemies.[33] Many clerics were also fluent in Supernal or Abyssal, as well as their related dialects.[33] Clerics of Mystra, Bane, Sel\u00fbne, Shar, Torm and Talos, each with differing traditions and abilities. In addition to the abilities common to all clerics, clerics also could access a number of powers through aspects of their god's portfolio known as divine domains. At the beginning of their career, a cleric chose one[31] - or occasionally two[34] - of the domains associated with their patron deity, giving them access to a number of unique prayers and abilities. These domains allowed clerics to prepare domain prayers each day from a list particular to that domain, in addition to their more general prayers.[31] Each domain also had a number of other benefits associated with it. For example, the Tempest domain allowed its clerics to return an enemy attack with thunderous or electrical power.[35] Similarly, the Life domain made clerics more adept at casting healing prayers.[36] While not every cleric specialized in a particular domain, most did.[31] Some of the most commonly accessed domains are listed below. Used commonly by worshipers of scholarly deities such Oghma[31] or Mystra[37], the Knowledge domain attracted those who believed learning was an end unto itself. Some deities presiding over the Knowledge domain were secretive and jealously guarded what they and their followers knew, while others promoted the spread of knowledge through the construction of libraries and universities. Other gods, like Gond, were more interested in the practical application of knowledge, rather than its research and discovery.[31] Clerics adhering to the Knowledge domain gained a number of abilities from their training. Some of these new skills were relatively mundane, such as learning another language or two. Others were considerably more powerful though, such as the ability to mentally \"read\" an object and to discover the details of its recent past.[38] The favorite of healers or those active in the fight against undeath, the Life domain was presided over by a number of diverse powers, from agricultural deities such as Chauntea to the sun god Lathander to deities of healing like Ilmater. The Life domain, which encompassed both healing and radiant-powered prayers, was fueled by the power of positive energy, found in the Positive Energy Plane. As a general rule, non-evil deities preferred this domain to evil ones.[36] The Life domain provided a number of unique abilities to its practitioners, encompassing both manifestations of positive energy. Among the healing abilities gained by Life domain clerics was the preserve life ability, a form of channeling divinity that allowed the caster to restore a severely wounded creature up to roughly half of its peak potential. In addition, experienced Life domain clerics obtained the ability to infuse their weapons with radiant energy drawn from the Positive Energy Plane.[36] Gods of light such as Helm or Lathander presided over this domain, which represented ideals such as renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty.[36] Some Light domain gods like Milil[37] were patrons of the arts, while others, such as Helm were stalwarts of duty, devoted to the expulsion of lies and the banishment of darkness.[36] The Light domain was generally favored by non-evil deities.[37] The abilities of Light domain clerics were generally light or fire-flavored. Among the most basic of these skills gathered was the light cantrip. Additionally, extremely experienced clerics specializing in the Light domain could generate an aura of bright light that lasted for up to a minute, shining into a space of up to 90\u202fft (27\u202fm) in radius. They were also able to enhance any spells cast in the area using fire or radiant power.[39] While many priests who served nature deities like Silvanus or Eldath were druids, clerics were also numbered among their servants. Many clerics who did venerate the gods of the wilderness made use of the Nature domain, which granted them some semblance of control over wild animals and plants alike. Whereas their druid compatriots were secretive and reclusive by inclination, clerics in the service of nature took a more active role, championing the cause of their gods by hunting evil monsters, blessing harvests, or bringing a famine upon their enemies.[39] Clerics specializing in the Nature domain had a number of abilities to claim as their own. One such ability was their ability to calm animals or plants, reducing their hostility for a period of up to a minute or so. With additional training, Nature domain clerics could learn even to control such creatures, commanding them to do as they wish.[35] The Tempest domain was the abode of a diverse array of gods, from storm gods like Talos to ocean gods like Umberlee. What all of these gods held in common was a violent temperament and a penchant for inspiring fear. Clerics who served these gods were much the same, wielding their powers to strike terror into the faithful, either to force the wicked back to righteousness or in order to compel ritual offerings in exchange for safety.[35] The abilities granted by Tempest domain deities to their clerics were destructive by their very nature. One such boon was the destructive wrath that could be invoked by channeling their deities' divinity, which increased the deadliness of electrical or sonic attacks cast by the cleric. In addition to such deadly powers, the most experienced Tempest domain clerics were also capable of flying, so long as they were neither indoors or underground.[35] Not all clerics were inclined to seriousness or self-righteous zeal. The clerics who served gods of the Trickery domain - a lot which includes Tymora, Beshaba, and Garl Glittergold - were mischievous troublemakers by their very nature, more akin to a rogue than a paladin by temperament. Clerics of this domain mocked the powerful and defied tradition, disrupting \"polite society\" wherever they went. Some were freedom-fighters, some were criminals, and others were just pranksters. Whatever their specific method, these clerics preferred to challenge, rather than accept, the conventional order of things.[40] Because Trickery domain clerics were more inclined to deception and misdirection than direct conflict, their abilities similarly diverged from some of the more martial characteristics of other priests. For example, many of the spells wielded by such clerics were illusions or enchantments, rather than direct attacks. Likewise, Trickery domain clerics could channel their deities' divinity in a form known as invoke duplicity, which allowed them to create one or more phantasmal copies of themselves, for the purpose of distraction or remote spellcasting.[41] War was a common part of mortal life and so it should come as little surprise that there were many clerics who devoted themselves to the gods of war. The nature of such gods varied somewhat, from champions of honor like Torm to pillars of destruction like Gruumsh, but they all held in common an interest in the act of fighting, watching over those in battle who offered them tribute. Clerics specializing in the War domain served these deities.[41] As might be expected, the abilities of War domain clerics enhanced such priests' ability to fight on the front-line. Early on, War domain clerics were trained in the use of heavy armor and martial weapons, giving them additional protection and making them deadlier foes. With more experience, War domain clerics could also attack foes with an uncanny degree of precision.[41] A shielding cleric. In addition to (or instead of) specializing in a domain, several clerics differentiated themselves to some small degree by focusing their training in a certain way. These different forms of cleric training often determined the specific abilities and approaches taken by clerics in their careers. Most clerics belonged to one of the below practices.[citation needed] Instead of focusing simply on their role as healers and inspirational icons of their deity, battle clerics preferred to get into the thick of a fight, leading the charge of the faithful. These clerics were almost always physically well-built, building their muscles and fortitude to make them effective melee combatants in their god's service. These clerics still put an emphasis on strong judgement and awareness of both others and oneself, but an additional priority was put on physical power, as was leadership ability and strength of personality.[23] Devoted clerics took the opposite philosophy of battle clerics and put all of their efforts into becoming the very best ministers of the faithful that their god had to offer. Wholeheartedly loyal to their god and his or her followers, devoted clerics trained primarily in prayers that enabled or healed their allies. For this reason, devoted clerics felt that wisdom and charisma were of far greater importance than physical strength, though they did not wholly abandon its usage.[23] Shielding clerics, like devoted clerics, believed that it was more important to protect and shield allies rather than to fight directly. While other clerics often used prayers to both deal damage and inspire their allies, shielding clerics hung back, using their divine gifts to heal and protect others rather to deal attacks. When shielding clerics did strike, it was often from afar, rather than in a melee. For instance, unlike battle clerics and devoted clerics, shielding clerics didn't have the ability to use the turn undead prayer. Instead, shielding clerics channeled their deities' divine power through the healer's mercy prayer. Shielding clerics also put a higher emphasis on wisdom and charisma than strength, similar to devoted clerics.[42]",

They were wary of evil beings, but were willing to serve as a companion to another being if treated well and respected.[citation needed] Pseudodragons inhabited temperate forests in the wild, but they could often be found as familiars in nearly any environment.[citation needed] King Haedrak Rhindaun III of Tethyr had a platinum-colored pseudodragon named Purlakhonthiis.[8] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.

        "description": "      It was an enormous worm-like creature with a hide covered in chitinous plates that were dark purple in hue, with a mouth filled with teeth at one end and a poisonous stinger on the other. A mature purple worm had a body 5\u202ffeet (1.5\u202fmeters) wide and 80\u202ffeet (24\u202fmeters) long, and 40,000\u202fpounds (18,000,000\u202fgrams) in weight.[4] They moved by alternately compressing and expanding their bodies, which made them capable of sudden speed.[2] When attacking, a purple worm coiled into a mass 20\u202ffeet (6.1\u202fmeters) wide, from which head and tail lunged to bite, grab, and sting anything within a range of 15\u202ffeet (4.6\u202fmeters). With its mouth, it could catch and swallow beings whole with ease; those swallowed were crushed and dissolved by stomach acids if they could not escape by cutting their way or using magic. The tail stinger inflicted a potent, debilitating venom.[4][2] They were highly skilled swimmers and possessed a tremorsense that let them sense everything in contact with the ground.[4] Varieties of purple worms were known to live in lakes or desert plains: Purple worm eggs were approximately 3\u202fft (0.91\u202fm) in diameter, silvery spheres with extremely hard shells. Purple worms often clustered their eggs together in groups of six and suspended them from their chamber walls by strands of sticky saliva.[8] After successfully hatching, these young creatures were known as purple wormlings. To be classed as wormlings, the creatures had to be less than 6 weeks old. At this point, the wormlings were about 9\u202fft (2.7\u202fm) long and weighed 1,500\u202flb (680,000\u202fg).[1] Purple worms were predators and scavengers who devoured whatever organic matter they came across; nothing was safe. They were capable of swallowing human- and horse-sized beings whole. However, as they tunneled through the ground they consumed much dirt and rock materials, which it broke down and excreted constantly. Purple worms in mineral-rich environments could leave castings contained unrefined ores and even precious metals and gemstones.[4][2] Some adventures sought out purple worms' carcasses or casts for such treasures.[2] A purple worm erupting from the earth before (likely) devouring a group of individuals. Possessing only animal intelligence,[4] they were considered dim-witted. They went for any loud noise sensed underground as they hunted for food.[2] They lived underground, at least until they erupted from the earth to attack.[4] They were capable of chewing through solid rock as they hunted prey, and thus made many of the tunnels in the Underdark; a few in a food-rich area could create complex tunnel networks. Fortunately, they rarely returned to them, making them useful passages. Purple worms were naturally a menace to the denizens of the Underdark, and drow, duergar, and illithids all maintained magical wards against them.[2] However, they often came to the surface in mountainous and other rocky lands.[2] They were solitary creatures.[4] Purple worms laid eggs in areas sometimes called nurseries. Sometimes these areas were the homes of other creatures that formed a symbiotic relationship with the worms, lurking within their nurseries to hunt for prey that came searching for the worm's valuable eggs, thereby protecting them. Giant spiders and other creatures that had no direct interest in their eggs often served this purpose. Fomorian giants sometimes developed a relationship with the purple worms as well and became caretakers of the clusters of eggs.[8] Purple worm eggs were highly valued by wizards for various arcane rituals.[8] In 1367 DR, a mottled purple worm wandered into the submerged depths of Orvaskyte Keep.[10] There were rumored to be purple worms in the Underdark that had two heads due to mutation from faerzress.[11]",

Both their hands and feet were slender, with long, claw-tipped digits. Some quasits had a pair of bat-like wings that marked their visual similarity to imps.[4] When not doing the bidding of a greater evil, quasits might entertain themselves with minor acts of malicious mischief, such as curdling milk or plotting wicked schemes of their own.[1][9] They were not particularly smart, but their small size was not to be mistaken for an equally small mind. Quasits could rival the average human in brainpower, and normally possessed a deep cunning able to compensate for their lack of intellect. The small fiends excelled at deception, the words they spoke and their actual meaning rarely being the same thing.[6][10] Quasits were insidious creatures with a ceaseless craving for power in all its forms.[10] Despite this personal desire for power and success however, they were physically weak and mostly cowardly beings that shied away from direct confrontation.[1][4] Unlike most other members of their kind,[11] quasits had a healthy sense of self-preservation, and when cornered would do almost anything to survive.[10] Although they preferred to act alone, they normally familiarized themselves with the locations of other demons in case they found themselves in danger.[2][12] Quasits shared the imp powers of invisibility and resistance to both non-magical weaponry and pure magic.[1] A minor regenerative power also made quasits somewhat hard to kill over an extended period of time, and if killed they would reform in the Abyss in a year and a day.[5] Both were capable of detecting good and magic at will.[4] The abilities of a quasit that distinguished them from those of imps were few but vital. Unlike imps, their talons were coated in an irritating toxin that caused those they struck to be consumed with a burning itch, as opposed to a more directly deadly poison delivered through a stinger. Quasits also lacked the wings of imps, but could scamper on land faster than them. However, these differences were not universal, as some quasits were noted to have both stingers and wings.[1][4][5][10] Quasits, like imps, could also polymorph into one or two other choice forms, but in the case of a quasit they were normally bats, toads, centipedes, or wolves. Most notable of these differences was that while imps could use supernatural suggestion once a day, quasits instead could send a wave of terror at those nearby.[1][4][5] Quasits also had the ability to contact the forces of the Lower Planes, normally a demon lord, for communion every week to aid in their decision-making process.[6] Quasits in service to a master on the Material Plane bestowed several benefits. The two maintained a telepathic bond, breakable by the quasit at any time, allowing them to use the other's senses so long as they were within a mile of each other. So long as the two were only a few feet apart, the summoner gained the quasit's resistance to magic.[1] Despite their physical frailty, quasits could be fearsomely annoying and maddening to fight, able to wreak havoc and create unending distractions for their adversaries. Thankfully, unless they had some sort of advantage, most relied on their invisibility to flee battles rather than sticking around to battle.[10] When quasits did fight, they preferred to strike in ambushes rather than in normal fights, their various abilities making them capable assassins. Their most effective leading tactic was to turn into an innocuous animal, (although turning invisible would also work) to avoid detection as they approached their target, as truesight would be needed to discern a morphed quasit's real form.[10][4] A battle against a quasit was one of attrition as it used blinding speed to strike at its enemies before slinking away, allowing its poison to slowly debilitate their foe.[4] Those with wings swooped down to deliver their poison before retreating to the trees for cover. Since their poison reduced mobility and dexterity, their normal targeting order went from obvious spellcasters first, to those with ranged weapons, to general combatants like fighters and rogues, often trying to make the chosen target completely helpless first before attacking or fleeing. As such, means of delaying or neutralizing poisons were vital.[10] If the need for retreat arose, quasits would strike fear into their enemies before running away, an indication that something had gone horribly wrong since they reserved this ability otherwise.[10][4] Quasits were likely to change form in these instances if doing so would make it easier for them to escape. Trying to ambush one was difficult unless one was both non-good and lacked magical equipment, or had a way of disguising these things. Given their cowardice, a cornered quasit convinced that they were trapped, would be more than willing to trade information for their life, the particularly desperate even offering the use of commune, preventing them from lying.[10] Their mode of behavior was slightly different however when around other demons or serving a master. Quasits would rather manipulate more powerful beings to fight for them than even make their presence known to others. Often they whispered temptations of power when adversaries made themselves apparent, coaxing their masters into doing their bidding.[2] In these situations, a quasit acted as support, distracting enemies and sneaking up on them when unexpected.[10] Such tactics often didn't work on larger demons, and quasits would much prefer to just let them fight without interfering.[2] Quasits could be found infesting all but the most lawful of the Lower Planes, from Pandemonium and Carceri to Gehenna.[13] In general, the quasits of the Abyss were treated like children, albeit petulant brats.[10] They were versatile demons that assisted in many tasks throughout the Abyss, with jobs ranging from spies, messengers, counselors, emissaries, and domestic aids.[6] The legion of quasit servants of Lyktion in Baphomet's Endless Maze, for example, acted as cooks and cleaners.[14] Quasits were normally created from soul larvae or manes specifically for these myriad purposes, and so were nearly always in the employ of a higher power. Because of this, quasits could normally only ascend the Abyssal hierarchy through serving their masters diligently. Not standing out or abject failure could result in eternal servitude, being eaten, killed for fun, or worst of all being demoted back to a mane or larva.[6] The most well known duty of a quasit was being summoned to become the familiars of wizards and sorcerers who matched their chaotic evil alignment, or at least were not lawful or good.[15] Necromancers of sufficient experience could cast a variant of the find familiar spell and possibly get a quasit, while those who specifically practiced demonology were given quasit familiars that devoured any previous familiar the demonologist had.[16][17] Nar demonbinders could acquire a quasit as a familiar,[18] and some drow mages of sufficient experience could summon a quasit as a temporary ally.[19] Despite their clear bias towards those who could use them as familiars, other mortals of sufficient power, including those among orcs, hobgoblins, and gnolls, might also have quasits as advisers.[2][10] The quasit's job was to serve their master well and help them succeed in their endeavors, but this was merely a pretense to their true goal. In truth, quasits sought out arcane magic users with weak wills and strong impulses in a bid to make them behave with greater moral abandon, and eventually turn them into a magical outlet of destruction. The greater havoc their masters wrought the better, although they preferred their malice to target those least likely to already be headed to the Abyss so as to steal their souls first. This rule especially applied to those of lawful evil alignments, so as to prevent Hell's forces from growing in power.[2][6] Quasits would continue to serve their mortal master as long as they believed that they could still grow more powerful and commit greater atrocities, only wishing them dead when it became evident they would only become weaker or morally stronger. After driving their masters to destroy themselves, a quasit would hurriedly drag their soul back to the Abyss, along with any soul grabbed along the way, and present it to their true master in the hopes of being promoted. After evaluating their performance, based on the wickedness of the soul, a demon lord might send them back to try again if they'd justifiably failed, or else punish them. Those who furthered their master's cause enough could be promoted into a vrock, or even a hezrou as a reward.[2][6] Promising to help a quasit ascend the demonic totem pole could garner their temporary allegiance. Not all quasits, however, desired to climb that hierarchy, instead fleeing their tanar'ric masters at the first opportunity in the hopes of carving their own path in life.[20] Quasits on the Material Plane were often overcome by their own egos, and came to believe themselves more powerful and influential than they actually were.[10] Quasits sent to the Material Plane weren't even always expected to follow a diligent plan, instead being set loose to cause minor miseries, the souls found along the way intended to be a bonus.[20] Quasits were assigned genders at the whims of whoever their masters were, whether tanar'ri or mortal. Although they didn't have to rest, the constant orders they were normally given led many to relax on the Material Plane in the guise of an animal.[20] A quasit once terrorized the sewers of Waterdeep, riding on the back of a giant crocodile.[21] Laerekh, Chief Necromancer of the cult of Kiaransalee in Maerimydra, had a quasit familiar.[22] Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

        "description": "      The true form of a rakshasa was almost never seen due to their ability to assume almost any humanoid figure, but their lavish taste ensured they were almost always wearing the finest garments and most precious jewelry.[2] Their true forms were most commonly humanoids with the heads of tigers and luxurious fur to match their attire, although it was not unusual for them to possess the heads and features of carnivorous apes, crocodiles or mantises,[2][7] with high ranking rakshasas being rumored to have multiple heads.[5] The eyes of a rakshasa could range from gold and black slits for felines to protruding, multifaceted spheres for insects but always contained a fiendish glimmer of disturbing, infernal intellect.[7] However, their most unnerving and unique feature was their reversed hands. The palms of a rakshasa faced out from the body when the arms were at rest and the finger joints bent backwards to grasp and manipulate objects.[2][7] Rakshasas stood 6\u20127\u202fft (1.8\u20122.1\u202fm) tall, with those of lower rank being shorter.[5] Their build was typical for a human of their size and they weighed between 250\u2012350\u202flb (110\u2012160\u202fkg).[3][7] Unsettling others with their eerily structured hands demonstrated a mere fraction of a rakshasa's true maliciousness, as their wickedness rivaled that of devils and their avarice surpassed them.[7] Their animalistic appearance disguised a sophisticated personality with an unstoppable lust for influence and material wealth.[2][7] A rakshasa in his best finery. They combined the habits of a predatory aristocrat with those of an indolent cat, savoring the finest art, music, literature, clothing, weapons and armor while spending large amounts of time lazily resting in their comforts and prowling unseen. Powerful magic, lost spells, arcane tomes and secret lore, particularly those of the evil variety, were of special interest to the born sorcerers. Slaves were collected the same as any other form of art, and were expected to indulge every whim of their cruel master.[7] This served to bolster the already overinflated ego of the rakshasa, a haughtiness they displayed to all who knew their true identity.[5][7] Rakshasas used their transformative abilities to appear as nobles, cardinals, merchant princes, crime lords and other beings rich in power.[1][2] They used their natural charisma to form vast arrays of minions, lackeys, servitors and henchmen, and despite their pride were masters of deceit. Rakshasas disguised not only their forms, but their very involvement in events, pulling political strings, creating vast intrigues, and instigating government corruption to secure their safety.[7] Their innate cleverness was enhanced by their supernatural abilities, and yet countered by their strange sense of honor, as like devils they would hold to the letter of an agreement while ignoring the spirit to double-cross their supposed allies.[5][7] Rather than steal from other powerful beings, rakshasas favored robbing the poor and needy, using their assumed authority to obtain riches and items from those that needed them most.[7] Their ability to gain dominion and rise to power while causing others to fall was a source of pride and joy for them.[1][7] They would plot the death of a mortal's family, take everything they had, and ruin their reputation through vicious slander, but nothing brought them more pleasure in this activity than turning a model citizen's society against them by exposing hidden truths.[7] Upon reaching independence, rakshasa usually attempted to establish their own territories as far away from any other rakshasas as possible, utilizing their mastery of disguise to carefully investigate a region for years while staying insignificant.[7] They instinctually sought out hideaways, safe houses and secret lairs from which to conduct their schemes and display their opulence, their lives often shifting between periods of hedonistic pleasure and unyielding discipline.[5][7] Thieves' guilds, mercenary companies, business fronts or temples to neutral deities were suitable covers and if no such thing could be found, the rakshasa would be forced to create one itself.[7] At the same time, they searched for those of weak wills, dark secrets and crippling fears, collecting every possible detail about their hidden vices through their thought detection ability and pre-established connections. If bribery and temptation were not sufficient, they would use extortion and slander, threatening to ruin the target's life if they refused to comply. Spies and informants were monitored by more reliable and easily controlled servants and as their cruel criminal empires spread, subjects under their control, whether a victim of their greed or a knowing servitor, found the rakshasa's demands grow more unreasonable and time-consuming.[7] Most rakshasas that focused on self improvement, despite already being leagues beyond ordinary mortal casters, tried to improve their sorcerous abilities.[3] If not personally studying magic or attempting to discover sources of arcane power, some sponsored adventuring parties under the guise of an interested individual or organization, sending such groups on quests to obscure locations or supposedly dangerous regions. [7] Rakshasas were naturally adept sorcerers, able to use a wide variety of enchantment and illusion spells to beguile their enemies and detect the thoughts of others at will.[1][3] Most magic was of no use against rakshasas, as only some of the most powerful spells were able to affect them unless they allowed it.[3][5] Only potent, enchanted weapons were capable of properly harming them, but piercing weapons that had been blessed, or potentially those wielded by good creatures, were particularly effective. Blessed crossbow bolts and arrows were said to instantly kill them, but it was said they had to be pierced through the heart with such weapons to truly slay them.[1][2][5] Rakshasas could shapeshift as long as they desired and their new forms could not be magically dispelled, although truesight could pierce their guise and they reverted to normal upon death.[3] Their claws contained a magical curse that plagued the minds of those struck with nightmares and terrifying figments, preventing them from resting properly unless the curse was removed.[1] A rakshasa warrior. In the repertoire of a rakshasa, their most powerful weapon was their mastery of misdirection as they used their expertise in deceit they entangle their enemies in webs of mistruths. Their illusory powers and vast array of potential identities made even recognizing their existence a struggle and even then it took skill and careful planning to defeat them. Powerful divination magic was required simply to dispel their supernatural deceptions but they nonetheless had many ways to win without fighting.[7] Rakshasas had entire networks of corrupt officials and powerful bodyguards at their disposal, and only allowed their most loyal and trustworthy minions near them. Only a small number of their closest aides knew of their true form and so enchantment magic was often needed in order to prompt a betrayal by such servitors.[7] Rakshasas fought as cravens when behind their numerous protections, using magic to enhance their speed or defenses, attempting to use their enchantment magic to dissuade combat and targeting spellcasters due to their typical inability to harm them.[7] Often times they would attempt to masquerade as an ally of their prey, waiting for the right moment to strike them down.[5] Unless protected by a spell such as mind blank or nondetection they would instantly sense the location of thinking creatures, but would need to focus their efforts on a specific area for a few seconds in order to decipher a potential adversary's surface thoughts, forcing them to stay nearby while attempting to discern intentions. When under attack, rakshasas rarely used their mind reading in the open, instead using hit and run tactics to maneuver to an area of safety and read the enemies' plans, allowing strategies to be changed when needed.[7] Offensive magic was normally saved as a last resort and most disdained physical fighting as ignoble.[7][3] In contrast to their typically elusive nature, rakshasas when cornered fought valiantly and fiercely, proving themselves to be dangerous melee combatants in addition to being powerful spellcasters.[3][5] Their reversed hands gave them no trouble in terms of dexterity, allowing them to wield weapons with dangerous effectiveness, a necessary skill as their shapechanging prevented them from using their teeth and claws. Rakshasas trained as warriors pounced like tigers with their blades while archers were just as deadly. However, most rakshasas took every measure needed to prevent physical altercations and, if the opportunity presented itself, would immediately abandon melee in order to continue casting from afar, attempting to blind and confuse current assailants to escape.[2][3] Rakshasa communities on the Outer Planes were protected by greater rakshasas or ruhks, a term meaning knight, skilled warriors of great speed and martial prowess.[2][5] 15% of rakshasas were ruhks and 15% of the ruhks were rajahs, a term meaning lord, that led their clans. 5% of rajahs were maharajahs, a term meaning duke, that led several small interrelated clans or singular massive clans. Their island societies were composed of hundreds of members with the duke as the unquestionable leader, although dukes were known to serve under even more dangerous entities and clans would be run by a rajah in the absence of a maharajah.[5] The rakshasas of Acheron were infamous beings that laired on hidden cubes veiled from prying eyes by powerful illusion magic. Each clan kidnapped petitioners and planewalkers to serve as slaves in their palaces in an attempt to impress the maharajah that ruled over every rakshasa on the plane.[10] Befitting beings of deception, early reports on rakshasa society contradicted later descriptions, although both were based on subservience and subjugation and it was possible some combination of the two was present. Earlier claims were that rakshasas belonged to a unshakable caste system and that individuals were incapable of rising through the ranks.[5] Later descriptions portrayed it as a meritocracy based on guile and ruthless immorality, where rakshasas constantly waged conspiratorial wars against each other. Enslavement, rakshasa or not, was an indication of power and their political battles ended either in the death or domination of the loser. As rakshasas grew in reputation and prestige they would gain the noble titles of ruhk and rajah, reaching maharajah status after the successful conquest of all others rakshasas in the region.[7] Female rakshasas, rakshasi, raised children independent of males, teaching their children vital lessons about their society. Rakshasi were unyielding disciplinarians, but the rigorous and ruthless tests they employed were contrasted by their pampering praise. The reason for this was likely the patriarchal nature of rakshasa society, as females were meant only to be faithful, childbearing spouses that raised powerful offspring. The rakshasi population was somewhere between having just as large a population as males and having three times their numbers, and males could very well have harems.[5][7] The nature of power was important in a rakshasa's education, as they learned that those in power could just as easily retract their gifts as they could bestow them. Mature rakshasas wasted no time establishing their criminal empires and may have already done so.[7] The rakshasa served the lesser god Ravanna a ten-headed being that was the paragon of their tyrannical ideals of decadence, cunning and narcissism. Most clerics were chosen by Ravanna based on his needs and desires rather than them coming to serve him and it was practically suicidal by those who knew of him to ignore commands for such summons from his great priests.[7] He commanded his servitors to rule and expand from the shadows, giving his clergy the air of a secret criminal organization and was not adverse to choosing members of other races to be part of his priesthood. Befitting a being of such overwhelming egomania, prayers to Ravanna were longwinded and sycophantic while depreciating the value of the speaker. His devotees commonly carried personal shrines with which to make daily sacrifices of blood and coin with their natural armaments, made both artistic and ornate but easily concealable on short notice.[7] Within the Abyss, chaotic evil rakshasas were known to serve another lesser god, Kali.[11] The demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu, Prince of Deception, also commanded a great number of chaotic evil rakshasas known as the Hollow Rajahs.[12] Rakshasas were known to speak Common and Infernal but occasionally learned Sylvan and Undercommon. Even when not in one of their myriad of alternate forms, rakshasas were not as they first appeared. Rakshasas were, in truth, immortal, fiendish spirits that bound themselves to the Material Plane within the guise of flesh, so intrinsically deceptive that their very essence could be used in potions of delusion.[5] Despite their immortality, death was excruciatingly painful for a rakshasa as it meant wandering the Lower planes as an incorporeal being, waiting in unending agony for their bodies to reform.[1][7] Rakshasas suffered no loss of memory, power or vitality from death but the process landed them in a random spot and could take somewhere between days and years, by which time mortals who had wronged them may have already passed on. When unable to take vengeance upon their killers, rakshasas often avenged themselves upon their kin or allies. Slaying a rakshasa banished to the Lower Planes permanently destroyed them but it was said they could be killed on the Material Plane by driving blessed weapons through their hearts.[1][7] Every century, a new rakshasa generation would be born to replace their fallen progenitors and the race had been known to spread.[5][6] The Imaskaran arcane Tome of the Ring recorded a crafting recipe for a ring of regeneration. The recipe called for fenberries, an eye of a rakshasa, and the spell of Melf's acid arrow.[13] Outside of a strange, paradoxical method of gaining honor, rakshasas tormented, beguiled and killed humanity in order to consume their flesh.[5]They considered it a delicacy and preferred their meat as raw as possible, especially while it still lived. Their meals were flavored with exotic spices, accompanied by odd side dishes and other expensive, choice foods considered revolting to most mortals.[7] Although they themselves lacked predators, outside of trained hunters and mortal victims seeking retribution, rakshasas were speculated to be few in numbers, with populations possibly smaller than those of dwarves.[5][7][14] They favored tropical jungles, swamps and island environments, even when on other planes.[5][7] Chaotic rakshasas could be found within the blood-red tropics of the 500th layer of the Abyss or the toxic archipelagoes of Vudra.[11][15] Despite their solitary leanings, rakshasa subraces were known to cooperate even as they pursued their individual agendas.[16] An ak'chazar rakshasa. A naztharune rakshasa. Tieflings descended from rakshasas had cat eyes and potentially fur, scales or leathery skin.[17] For whatever reason, deva aasimars that lost their way and became truly wicked risked being reborn as rakshasas in their next lives.[18] Despite there being innumerable documented cases of rakshasas influencing worldly politics the known examples were but a fraction of the extent of their duplicitous exploits. Scholars that investigated their sinister schemes found that they could be connected to the downfall of several organizations, merchant houses, and churches, the instigators of unspeakable tragedies and the collapse of entire governments. The elimination of investigative scholars was one of the few occasions during which rakshasas would unite. The exact origins of the rakshasas were shrouded in mystery and legend, not helped by the proud and insidious rakshasas themselves that, if they knew their history, would never willingly share it and likely went out of their way to make it confusing and contradictory.[7] Rumors that claimed arcanaloths were originally demons that were banished from the Abyss for their deceptiveness also stated that they were the ancestors of the rakshasas and raavastas. Rakshasas strongly disputed such stories despite their demon-like cruelty, greed, and conniving nature, dismissing them as slurs against their honorable race and an accusation of degeneracy.[2][19] More recently, it was claimed that the rakshasas were the result of an infernal ritual from Hell, made from an enigmatic but nonetheless powerful race of devils in a bid to escape Baator. Indeed, rakshasas had various hallmarks of devilish descendance and more popular ideas were that they were caused by a union of ancient fiendish animals and devils.[1][7] Still, it was entirely possible that rakshasas were an entirely distinct race of fiends as their specific brand of malevolence was utterly unique.[7] Many, less specific legends merely stated they came from \"a distant land\" like a poverty-inducing plague to corrupt and drain every society they came across[7] and some said that the horror-inflicting fiends were the manifestation of nightmares.[1][5] Other Fiends\nAchaierai \u2022 Barghest \u2022 Canomorph (Haraknin \u2022 Shadurakul) \u2022 Hell hound \u2022 Hordling \u2022 Howler \u2022 Larva \u2022 Maelephant \u2022 Marrashi \u2022 Night hag \u2022 Nightmare \u2022 Rakshasa \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Vargouille \u2022 Yeth hound",

        "description": "   These creatures were very literal minded and often distracted by shiny objects. They were intelligent enough to be taught how to speak.[5] Ravens could be found across much of the continent of Faer\u00fbn, so much so that it was difficult to find an area devoid of them. Some regions included the High Moor[6] and the fens and moors of the Moonshae Isles.[7] Beyond Faer\u00fbn, ravens inhabited the continent of Kara-tur.[8]. Beyond the surface of Toril, large numbers of ravens could be found living in the asteroid known as the Castle, in the center of the Tears of Sel\u00fbne.[9] Outside of the Prime Material plane, ravens inhabited the Celestial Bureaucracy's plane of Qui,[10] the Domains of Dread,[11] the plane of Acheron,[12] and along the most commonly traveled branches of Yggdrasil, the World Ash.[13] These creatures typically harbored animosity towards owls.[5] The Raven Queen commanded numerous flocks of ravens from her divine realm in the Shadowfell. The ravens acted as the Queen's scouts and messengers across the multiverse, also alerting and guiding her shadar-kai servants to the location of items and memories that she wished to collect.[14] Ravens were also allies to wereravens and were usually found together. It was very common for kindnesses of wereravens to hide in plain sight among unkindnesses of ravens.[15] In the city of Ravens Bluff, a business known as the Raven Express used trained ravens to deliver mail.[16]",

        "description": "   The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons were also the most fearsome and cruel. These dragons delighted in ruin, death and destruction.[8] They breathed a cone of fire.[4] Red dragons were physically distinguished by their enormous size and wingspan. They had two large horns upon their heads, which pointed backwards toward their wings. They smelled of smoke and sulfur.[10] Like all chromatic dragons, reds lived their lives in cycles of activity and hibernation. While these cyclical rhythms weren't as extreme as green dragons, red dragons sealed themselves within their lairs for upwards of ten years at a time.[11] During their active periods they were known as voracious over-hunters, whose hunger ensured that the populations of any nearby creatures did not grow beyond ecological stability.[12] A red dragon with a humanoid in its grasp Red Dragons believed that they were the pinnacle of draconic nature and that all other species were impure. They valued vengefulness, rapaciousness, avarice, and ferocity above other traits and recognized these traits in themselves with pride. They were solitary creatures and cared little for news of other types of dragons. However, they did look for news of other red dragons in their area.[8] If they believed their own achievements and possessions to be greater than these other red dragons then they stayed in their caves, smugly congratulating themselves. However, if they learned that the achievements or possessions of the other red dragons were greater than their own they would fly into a vengeful rage, decimating the surrounding area until they believed that they had outdone their rivals. The dragon became much less cautious during this time and much more likely to underestimate their foes.[8] A red dragon would go to extreme lengths to ensure that they were superior to every other red dragon in the area. They would often burn down only half a village or let a single adventurer flee from a battle so that word of their power spread throughout the region. Not only would this anger other red dragons but it was also like a shining beacon to adventurers and treasure hunters.[8][10] Red dragons despised weakness among their own kind. If one ever found out that another of their kin demonstrated any signs of fragility, either by getting badly wounded or if they were becoming senile in old age, then local red dragons would descend on the lair, stripping it clean and usually killing the owner. They believed that if a red dragon could not protect what it had, then it did not deserve it to begin with.[13] Reds were also highly territorial. Entering an area a red considered its domain was just asking to be attacked, especially if it was another dragon entering the area (even more so if it was a red dragon). Conflict was inevitable if this were the case and it was almost always to the death as neither would dare show weakness to the other. Thankfully, most other species were smart enough to flee if they realized the area belonged to a red dragon. Red dragons could get so territorial that in rare occasions they would adopt a protective yet patronizing attitude towards creatures they considered inferior that lived within their self-imposed borders.[8] Red dragons hated any authority other than their own. They never asked elders for advice, even if doing so would save their lives as to them, admitting they needed something their elders had was the same as putting themselves under their authority.[citation needed] A red dragon incinerating a pesky adventurer. Red dragons expelled an extremely devastating cone of fire.[1] Adventurers which were either banded together too tightly or lacked fire protection would likely find themselves burned to a crisp before they could even begin to battle the mighty enemy. Red dragons prefer to fight with their physical bite and claws, but they might barbecue obviously powerful or numerous foes before bloodletting with glee. The dragons would also prefer not to use their breath on particularly weak enemies so as to not destroy the valuable treasure they carry.  A review of red dragon anatomy. Red dragons made their homes in mountainous lairs particularly throughout the peaks of northwestern and northern Faer\u00fbn, surrounding the great desert of Anauroch.[14] They were particularly abundant around the snow-capped mountains of the Spine of the World.[15] Some red dragons have been spotted as far south as the Sunset Mountains, or even Tethyr,[16] though they generally avoided any rangers near \"civilized\" lands.[14] Red dragons loved to make their lairs in deep, underground caves in mountainous regions. Many preferred to dwell in volcanoes, where the intense heat kept others at bay. Almost all red dragons simply required a high perch. The higher the better as they believed that their domain encompassed all that they could see.[10] Young red dragons, especially wyrmlings were easy prey for predators and hunters due to their bright, glossy scarlet scales, so they tended to stay underground in the darkness until they felt that they could defend themselves properly.[10] Many red dragons were known to worship the deities Bane, Garyx, Loviatar, and Malar.[17] Mating was initiated by the female every century or so when she felt the urge to have children. She looked for the nearest red dragon with the most wealth and power. As such, males never denied their advances. It was a sign of prestige among other males to be requested to mate.[13] After mating, the male then abandoned her while she hatched her eggs. She jealously guarded the clutch, occasionally with the assistance of an infertile female, but rarely laid down her own life for her hatchlings.[13] An average red dragon clutch had four eggs and had an incubation time of 270 days.[10] A red dragon notices the last survivor of a burning town. Once her young reached the young adult stage of development, or sometimes earlier, the mother's natural instincts overruled her maternal ones and she forced all of her young from her territory.[13] Red dragons hated silver dragons with a passion as their familiarity with the element of cold and other natural powers often made red dragons appear weak in battle with them. They also commonly came into conflict with copper dragons for territory rights, though copper dragons rarely won out against the more powerful red dragons in open conflict.[8] Above all though, red dragons hated gold dragons. Red dragons might loudly proclaim that they would fight and defeat any gold dragon they came across but often found an excuse not to fight when that time eventually came. Gold dragons were so similar to red dragons yet their natural moral differences were extreme.[8] A small contingent of red dragons served high-ranking githyanki as mounts and companions, following a treaty established with Tiamat during the war between the gith and the mind flayers. The dragons served the githyanki during their young age, being dismissed as soon as they reached adulthood and keeping the wealth accumulated over their years of service.[18] The dragons resented their time of servitude, but were eager to participate in raids thanks to the promise of treasure and of growing in power. The dragons remained loyal to their riders as long as they were treated respectfully and were given ample opportunities to pillage.[18] It was said the flesh of red dragons tasted extremely spicy. To be properly prepared, it had to be exposed to open air for at least two days and aged for some time. Anyone who ate red dragon meat that was not treated in this manner was susceptible to horrible cramps and extreme pain.[19] In addition, the bones and scales of all dragons can be used to craft powerful magical equipment with the correct know-how (for example, dragon scale mail). The equipment would usually be imbued with the elemental powers of the dragon it came from, so in the case of red dragons, such equipment would either protect from or deal fire damage. \"Visiting\" a red dragon's lair could be a reckless endeavor.

        "description": "   All shark species were utterly fierce, aggressive, and fearless. They were relentlessly hungry.[3][2][1] Sharks were tactical hunters, using their keen senses to circle their prey just outside of their field of view and charging to attack at the most opportune moment. Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth were effective against many different targets, sometimes even ship hulls.[3][2][1] These creatures had been swimming in the oceans for thousands of years with little change in their appearance or methods.[2] Sharks were categorized into medium, large, and huge species.[3] Large sharks included hunter sharks that preyed on deep waters, and fleshtearer sharks, which were found in various environments, including underground rivers and lakes.[1][2] They usually hunted alone, but could also be found in groups.[1] A species of muck-dwelling freshwater shark known as barbfish inhabited lower reaches of the Riven Specie in Amn.[6] The smaller types of sharks were very common in the waters surrounding Chult. The Bay of Chult and Refuge Bay contained large groups of reef sharks. Hunter sharks and reef sharks hunted off the coast of Ishau, as well as Jahaka Anchorage.[10] In the Shining Sea, they lurked in the sunken ruins of Untisczer.[11] Mako, goblin, and hammerhead sharks lived and hunted in the close vicinity of the Temple-Under-The-Sea, the submerged temple to Umberlee in the Fiddler's Green underwater region of the Sea of Swords.[5] Outside of the Prime Material plane, sharks were extremely prevalent in Draga Salt-Biter's domain of Saragoss in the Domains of Dread.[12] Sharks were revered by sahuagin and could be trained by them. Their kinship to sahuagin was so strong that even wild sharks considered them allies and did not attack them. Sahuagin could also telepathically issue commands to nearby sharks.[13] Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari had a wide variety of sharks as servants in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.[14] Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold shark hides for 15 gp a piece.[15]",

It was ice-blue in color, had dozens of legs, and its back glowed red with an inner fire that could melt all but the strongest of metals. It had horns along its body and dagger-like teeth.[9] It naturally had very high magic resistance.[6] A remorhaz produced an incredible amount of heat, allowing it to take advantage of the vulnerability that many creatures in its native environment possessed. Its heat also allowed it to melt nonmagical weapons that struck its red-hot protrusions.[6] A remorhaz liked to wait in ambush for its potential prey. When a living creature drew near, the remorhaz sprang from the ground and struck.[3] It primarily used its teeth in combat, or swallowed its opponent whole and subjected it to its gizzard and fiery insides.[4] The chitin of the remorhaz could be used to make chitin armor.[10] The secretion of the remorhaz, called \"thrym\", was valuable to alchemists in making heat-related magical items.[5] Remorhazes were sometimes tamed by frost giants of the Spine of the World, who used them as guardians. However, because the remorhazes were wild creatures, they were likely to turn on their masters at any time.[11][3] Remorhaz eggs could be sold for the purpose of raising them as guards.[5] The tribe of the White Worm honored the remorhaz as their spirit animal.[12] Remorhazes were used by the monks of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose to test their disciples by riding them.[13] A resident of Ahtitlak attacking with a remorhaz companion. The inhabitants of Ahtitlak, a small village in the Great Glacier, formed a special bond with the remorhazes who shared the cavern the village was located in. They had a peaceful and symbiotic relationship with the remorhaz. The remorhazes treated the villagers as trusted companions, defending the village and its residents.[14] The villagers provided food and water, treated any wounds a remorhaz received with a special poultice, and built fires to keep their eggs warm. The villagers developed a unique saddle made from leather that allowed them to ride the remorhazes, which allowed them to patrol their territory.[14] Remorhazes were found in the Cloud Peaks,[15] the Spine of the World,[11] Icewind Dale,[9][16] Anauroch's High Ice,[17] the Great Glacier,[18] the Endless Ice Sea,[19] the Ice Mountains,[20] the Ice Run,[21] and the Glacier of the White Worm (named for the creatures).[22] Remorhazes have also been spotted in the Fangs of the Cloud Peaks along the Trade Way.[23][15] The Opoboquo remorhaz was a unique species of remorhaz was native to the Opoboquo Valley of the Keryjek Ridge. An Opoboquo remorhaz was only about 10\u202ffeet (3\u202fmeters) long, light green in color, and not nearly as hot as its cousins. Angulutiuns hunted the Opoboquo remorhaz to use its shell to make jakerek, a fast caribou sled.[18]",

They could weigh as much as 6,000\u202fpounds (2,700\u202fkilograms).[4][note 1] Depending on species, they could have one or two horns on their snouts.[6] Their upper lips were almost prehensile, an ability they used for feeding.[8] These creatures were known to be bad tempered and to attack anything they perceived as a threat, intruder, or annoyance.[6][5][4] Some species were less aggressive and more likely to flee.[6][5] Their senses of smell and hearing were sharp, but their eyesight was limited,[6][5] though some possessed low-light vision.[4] On the Steaming Isles where all beasts were intelligent and capable of speech, the black rhinoceroses spoke little and thought of the birds (which often sat on their backs) as ceaseless, irritating gossips. The rhinoceroses were loyal to the Law of the Loregiver, yet had no interest in the affairs of the ruling pashas.[9] They were encountered alone[6][5][4] or in herds of up to six[6][5] or twelve specimens,[4] including a few young.[6][5] A rhinoceros charging through two warriors. Faced with threats or intruders, a rhinoceros charged them, lowering its head to gore them with its horn in a devastating assault.[6][5][4][3][2] The force could knock a target down.[2] Afterward, it might trample them with its forelegs.[6][5] They lived on tropical savannahs[5] and other warm plains.[4] In Faer\u00fbn, they were found in the southern grasslands,[10] such as in Chult, where they were common;[1] on the warm plains of the Shaar; in the hills around the Great Rift; and in Halruaa and the Shining Lands.[11] In Kara-Tur, rhinoceroses lived in subtropical forest areas.[12] In Zakhara, black rhinoceroses were found on the Steaming Isles, though these ones were also intelligent.[9] Wild dwarf priests of Thard Harr wore the skulls of big jungle beasts like rhinoceroses as helms.[13][14] The human Rhinoceros Tribe of the Shaar based both their name and their charging combat style on the beasts they shared the plains with.[15] An orc riding on a rhinoceros warbeast wearing partial scale barding. A rhinoceros could potentially be mounted and ridden into battle,[3][16] such as when trained as a dedicated warbeast.[17] A young rhinoceros could cost 200 gp, and 50 gp more to train,[8] a rhinoceros warbeast could cost 775 gp,[17] and a mature mount as much as 2,600 gp.[3] Compared to horses and the like, they cost 10 gp per day more to feed and maintain. Despite the cost, their willingness to charge foes in battle, as well as their ability to carry even fragile things with their lips with training, made them rather useful. Dwarves and ogres preferred a war rhinoceros.[8] Rhinoceroses, or just their horns, were traded in caravans across the Hordelands in the mid\u201314th century DR. Usually, only one or two of the animals were transported in a wagon with a dedicated handler.[18] Rhinoceros hide, like elephant hide, could be used to make a suit of hide armor; its greater thickness gave greater protection than leather armor.[19] In the mid\u201314th century DR, such armors were worn by General Batu Min Ho of Shou Lung[20] and the druid Thurghom as far north as the Frozen Wastes.[21] A druid could potentially have a rhinoceros animal companion,[22] such as those who lived in deserts.[23] A rhinoceros ally could be summoned with the spell summon nature's ally V,[24] summon desert ally VI,[25] or conjure animals,[26] while a fiendish rhinoceros could be summoned with summon monster VI.[27] Find greater steed summoned a celestial, fey, or fiendish spirit to assume the form of a beast that would serve as a mount, including a rhinoceros.[28] A wild rhinoceros might even appear from a wand of wonder[29] A piece of rhinoceros hide, swallowed by the caster, was a material component for the metal skin spell.[30] The spell rhino's rush gave one the charging power of a rhinoceros.[31][32] A rhinoceros was one of the exhibits in the menagerie of the Sea Maidens Faire in Waterdeep in 1492 DR.[note 2] It was kept in a pen on the Heartbreaker with the other beasts.[33]",

Chargers, or more plainly warhorses were those horses bred to ride in battle.[9] Light warhorses were referred to as coursers while heavy warhorses were known as destriers.[10] Some of the best-trained horses were trained by the elven House Korianthil.[11] Horses were considered sacred to many faiths of Faer\u00fbn. Warhorses were important to followers of Anhur, the Red Knight, and Tempus. Pinto and piebald horses were particularly favored by Deneir; palomino horses to Waukeen. Gray-haired horsed were sacred to Mask, while white ones were sacred to Milil, and chestnut-colored horses to Sune. Mystra favored donkeys, horses, and mules with blue or mismatched eyes. Intelligent horses were also native to the celestial realms of Sehanine Moonbow.[12] Horses were a kind of novelty for Thymari dragonborn, as such beasts weren't common in Abeir. As such, horses, specially warhorses were highly valued by Thymari, who cared for them as precious friends.[13] A white horse was the symbol for the sun elf house of Evanara.[14]",

From the head to the base of the tail, rocs were a minimum of 30\u202fft (9.1\u202fm) long, and as much as 60\u202fft (18\u202fm). Their wingspans were a staggering 80\u2012120\u202fft (24\u201237\u202fm), and rocs weighed some 8,000\u202flb (3,600\u202fkg).[3][4] Adventurers be warned: Stealing roc eggs is inadvisable! Rocs hunted, and attacked, by swooping down from the sky with talons outstretched to snatch and carry off prey. A single roc would be hunting, and therefore willing to try and take any suitably sized creature, but a pair of rocs would act in concert and fight to the death to defend the nest and eggs or hatchlings.[3] Rocs were massive birds of prey that were known to carry off very large prey, including cattle and horses, and even elephants. They typically lived in warmer, mountainous regions, and dwelled far apart from each to avoid straining the supply of prey. Rocs hunted in a territory of about 10\u202fmi (16,000\u202fm) around their nest.[3] The lair of a roc was a vast nest of trees, branches, and the like. Its treasure was strewn about, for the creature did not place any value upon it.[3] The egg was large, green, and spotted.[7] Rocs were usually solitary, but sometimes found in mated pairs.[3] Rocs often guarded the nests of simurghs until they were mature.[8] Rocs were occasionally tamed and used by giants.[9] Roc feathers were commonly used in manufacturing Quaal's feather tokens and brooms of flying.[4] The egg of a roc and the most dangerous omelette ever. Rocs were found in the Utter East, making their nests in the Serpent Valley, Web Mountains, and even underground in the Realm of Fire. Their nests could hold treasure from past victims, if one dared brave the parent and hatchling.[7] Lord Charles Frederik LaVerne Blacktree IV was known for wearing a roc feather in his hat.[10]",

The roper then drew its prey into its fang-filled mouth to consume. As a roper never knew when its next meal was coming, it often slew and ate more than it could possibly consume at once.[3] There were some varieties of ropers that had evolved on the surface of the world. They took the shape of dead tree trunks and hid within the forest.[citation needed]   Despite their monstrous hunger and evil natures, ropers were intelligent and insightful creatures. In the time between feedings, they learned about their surrounding underworld and contemplated philosophy. Religious pilgrims sometimes braved the lair of a roper for a chance to learn the creature's insight.[citation needed]",

The trapped creature could not breathe while imprisoned and was slowly crushed by the rug unless freed. While a rug of smothering had a creature in its grasp, it had the ability to deflect part of any damage it received to its victim.[1] Like all constructs, rugs of smothering were susceptible to antimagic effects.

Its hide was thick and lumpy and was yellowish tan on the belly and rust-red on the back. Its tail ended in what looked like a double ended paddle. Two long antennae come out of its head, one under each eye.[6] Normally a docile creature,[1] a rust monster could smell metal from ninety feet away. They always went for the biggest source of metal first, and preferred ferrous metals over precious ones.[6] A rust monster had a weak bite and did not normally attack with it.[6] They attacked anyone who had metal, however, with their antennae. The touch of an antenna could turn even magical metal items into rust.[6] Rust monsters ate the rust of freshly rusted metal objects.[6] Some sages speculated that rust monsters might be related to or the larval form of rust dragons[8] The extremely few rust monsters who lived long enough to reach old age somehow transported themselves to the plane of Acheron, where they ravenously consumed the abundant metal from the plane's cubes for about one year. Afterwards, they encased themselves in cocoons made of spun metal, where they stayed for three years. Following this period, they emerged from their cocoons as rust dragon wyrmlings.[9] It was not known, however, whether rust monsters were native to Acheron and only traveled to the Prime Material plane as a part of their larval cycle to become rust dragons, or if rust monsters were in fact native to the Prime and were altered by the magic of Acheron once transported there.[9] Rust monster antennae were used in the creation of rust blades. They found these items extremely delicious and nourishing.[10]",

Two large, curved fangs jutted out from their mouths, upon which their name was derived.[2] On average these measured around 6\u202finches (0.15\u202fmeters) in length.[3][4] These creatures were very aggressive and ferocious predators,[4] though were known to sometimes ignore prey that remained motionless.[2] Saber-toothed tigers rarely ever pursued prey over long distances. Often they would attack in groups, ambushing their prey. One half of a pride would startle and chase their prey, steering them straight into the direction of the other half.[2] In 640 DR, the people of Ormath and Lheshayl, as well as patrols from the Shining Plains, experienced frequent attacks from saber-toothed tigers.[7] In the late 15th century DR, a man in Barovia by the name of Rictavio owned a saber-toothed tiger.[8] Around that same time, Queen Bjornhild Solvigsdottir of the Tribe of the Tiger had a pet saber-toothed tiger named Grava.[9] These creatures lived in prides ruled over by female members and worked as a group, much like lions. Infighting over dominance, prey, territory, and mates was quite common. At times this could be quite lethal.[2] Weaker members of prides were often driven out in pairs, forcing them to set up their own hunting territories.[2] Saber-toothed tigers were a carnivorous species.[3] These creatures were most often known to prey upon giant elks,[10] brantas, glyptodons, horses, megaloceros, and mammoths.[2] These creatures were typically found in the forests of either warm or cold climate regions, as well as plains and hills. They laired within caves or small earthen dens when bearing and rearing their young.[2] Smilodons could be found in the Ice Spires,[11] the Shining Plains,[12][13] and much of the Savage Frontier,[14] In the late-15th century DR, they could be found in the jungles of Chult near the River Soshenstar, where they were mistaken by locals for a variety of Chultan tiger.[15] Beyond Toril, they inhabited the warm marshes and swamps of the planet Oerth.[16] Saber-toothed tigers were sometimes domesticated by neanderthals.[17] In the Ice Spires region, both frost giants and the Ice Spire ogres of Dour Fissure were known to have domesticated smilodons.[11] Some arctic rangers were known to have smilodons as animal companions.[18] The fangs of smilodons were a source of ivory, primarily fossilized ivory.[19]",

        "description": "   Although the correct term to address them as a race was sahuagin, those that fear or despised them usually called them \"sea devils\" or even more derisively, \"fish heads\".[8] Sahuagin were usually green-skinned; darker on the back and lighter on the belly. Many had dark stripes, bands, or spots, but these tended to fade with age. An adult male sahuagin stood roughly 6\u202ffeet (1.8\u202fmeters) tall and weighed about 200\u202fpounds (91\u202fkilograms). Sahuagin were highly fish-like, with webbed feet and hands, gills, and a finned tail. There was additional webbing down the back, at the elbows and, notably, also where human ears would be.[9] Some sahuagin developed towering physiques, reaching 9\u202ffeet (2.7\u202fmeters) tall.[10] The larger beings usually rose to higher positions, as the savage nature of the sahuagin enabled challenges to the death for higher status.[11] Females developed specks of yellow on their tails, which would grow in number until the whole tail was of a deep yellow color. At that point, the female was no longer considered fit for mating.[11] About one in every 216 hatchlings possessed four functional arms. Known as \"barons\",[1] these four-armed mutations were often black, fading to gray in color. While sahuagin usually killed off defective hatchlings, they allowed these to live.[12] If a sahuagin abode was near a sea elf community or was frequently visited by a sea elf, a strange mutation occurred within the sahuagin clan. About one in every 100 hatchlings appeared to look like a sea elf with greenish-silver skin and green or blue hair. These mutants were called malenti. Malenti were shunned by the clan as whole, but were protected by the clan's ruler and raised as spies by the clans best warriors and the priestesses.[12] Savage fighters, sahuagin asked for and gave no quarter; not even to children or babies.[13] They had wide and powerful jaws filled with long, sharp fangs, which they often used in battle. When swimming, a sahuagin tore with its feet or hands, striking with its talons or a weapon. Spears and tridents were their favored weapons, which they often coated in a poison they prepared.[14] About half of any group of sahuagin were also armed with nets that were laced with barbs.[5] Especially when in groups, they rode mantas as a means of transport to assault ships and other vessels.[8] They also used sharks as allies in battle, but the number of sharks they could control was limited to an unknown amount.[15] Although they excelled in physical prowess, they greatly feared magic, so they never tried developing or studying it for any purpose. Only priestesses of Sekolah used clerical magic granted by the god and even that magic was regarded with fear and as a necessary evil.[11] A sahuagin baron. Sahuagin were the natural enemies of aquatic elves and lizardfolk. Elves and sahuagin could not co-exist peacefully, and wars between them were often prolonged, bloody affairs that occasionally even interfered with shipping and maritime trade. Sahuagin tolerated the lizardfolk much more than they did the elves. Sahuagin had an only slightly less hatred for tritons. Exactly why the two races hated each other so much was unknown.[16] They also hated the kuo-toa and the morkoth, though it was not unheard of for these races to ally on occasion.[citation needed] They often raided Yurian villages, considering them a delicacy.[17] Sahuagin lived in underwater settlements that also had underground passages and tunnels, which connected the houses above the floor. Their society was strictly patriarcal, with a king ruling over princes, who in turn ruled over barons. Each baron ruled over a village, while a prince would dominate twenty villages and a king would govern an entire coastline. Kings would administer cities of several thousands inhabitants, and their palace were always much bigger than any of the other buildings in the area. Although they didn't rule, females had similar hierarchies among teachers, lore-keepers and priestesses.[18][19] They also had a very particular way of keeping lore, using what they called singing bundles\u2014conchs and shells supported by bone and sinew. When shaken, they made the clicking and hissing sounds of sahuagin language.[11] Multiple births were frequent among sahuagin and they dealt very harshly with offspring who were not robust or aggressive enough, eliminating them through compulsory fights to the death between the young. Sahuagin seemed fixated on all aspects of consumption and were eager to weed out anything they saw as weak or unworthy to compete for resources.[20] When going to war, sahuagin followed a certain protocol called the Laws of Battle. Sometimes however, a group of the sea devils would form a so-called Wild Hunt, which went on a frenzied rampage ignoring all rules.[21] Sahuagin spoke their own language, though some were known to also speak Common, Abyssal and Aquan.[2][3][1] Sahuagin could also communicate simple concepts to nearby sharks using telepathy. [22] Sahuagin worshiped Sekolah, god of sharks, as their patron deity and the father of their race. They also perceived him as the ultimate adjudicator and incarnation of punishment, officiating over an endless struggle between mythic figures. These figures were the hunter: \"He Who Eats\", and the hunted: \"He Who Is Eaten\", with the struggle between them reflected in every aspect of life. Because of this, sharks were seen as holy creatures to them, and dolphins were hated for their friendship with aquatic elves. The sahuagin made regular, living sacrifices to Sekolah by feeding beings to the sharks that followed every sahuagin priest.[citation needed]",

        "description": "   Salamanders were serpentine creatures with a humanoid torso, head, and arms, albeit with spines rising from their head, arms, and spine.[4][3] Salamanders tended to be greedy and cruel.[2] Salamanders often wielded spears. They used their tails to constrict their enemies. Their skin was so hot that even the merest touch caused burns.[3] Salamanders had an excellent culture of metalsmithing and creating weapons that utilized the power of flame.[2] Salamanders formed feudal societies led by kings/queens and dukes/duchesses. Slaves and lesser elemental creatures made up the peasant class.[2] Salamanders reproduced asexually, producing a single larva every ten years.[3] These larvae, called fire snakes, were small and unintelligent.[4] Many went on to become the somewhat larger and more intelligent flamebrother salamanders, although others remained fire snakes for their entire lives. From there, some flamebrothers became average salamanders, and those few average salamanders that were lucky and powerful enough to survive a thousand years became noble salamanders.[5] Salamanders originated on the Elemental Plane of Fire. A significant population of them migrated from the Plane of Fire via portals to the Firelands and the Peaks of Flame in Chult.[9] These salamanders posed a threat to the Mines of Segol[10] and the Hazur Mountains.[11] In the same manner salamanders also settled the sun of Realmspace.[12] The Blade Kingdoms were blessed with plumbing technology. The palaces and nobles' homes had intricate networks of copper plumbing set throughout and the hot water was generated via salamanders who stoked the boiler flames with coal and their own immense body heat. A group of salamanders lived in the Palace of Sumbria's higher floors and pumped hot water to the kitchens, council chambers and bedchambers.[13]",

Similarly, goat-like horns topped their heads; these came in a variety of shapes and sizes, from small nubs to big curling ones akin to a ram. They were typically seen with facial hair.[1] They had only a male sex, as female satyrs was a phenomenon that just never naturally occurred.[4] Satyrs were well known for being curious and incredibly hedonistic. They were willing to go to any length to achieve their desires, giving little thought to the results of their actions, and often roped other creatures into participating in debauchery.[1] When facing a foe, satyrs were typically known to fight with either a shortsword or shortbow. Their most notable weapon was a set of pan pipes that induced a variety of magical effects on their enemies, including charming, frightening, and lulling them to sleep. Other satyrs were immune to the effects of these pipes.[1] When weapons were not available in close quarters situations they often would simply ram their opponents with their heads.[1] Due to their hedonistic nature, satyrs were known to frequently join in the celebration of holidays regardless of what they were for.[1] Satyrs in elven woods were known to believe that it was lucky to see a dragon when it was raining.[9] Being an all-male race, the satyrs required mating with other creatures in order to reproduce. These creatures were specifically their fellow fey, the dryads[4][10] and oreads.[10] They also shared the dryads' affection for humans of the opposite sex.[4] Such pairings were likely to result in a child that was a half-fey human, rather than a true satyr.[11] Areas in the Realms where satyrs were known to be found included the following: Satyrs were sometimes utilized as messengers or agents for the gods Erevan Ilesere, Hanali Celanil, Mielikki, Sharess, Sheela Peryroyl, Silvanus, and Sune.[20] Satyrs were often known to serve unicorns whenever one dwelled within their forest.[21]",

        "description": "   A coven of three hags in Undermountain. Hags were universally hideous beings, but even by the unbelievably low standards applied to their race, sea hags were abysmally grotesque. Despite their penchant for devouring their victims they had an emaciated appearance,[1][3] although they could be of varying height and big-boned as opposed to scraggly.[8] Befitting their haggard nature, their flesh was also rife with warts and oozing cankers.[2][3] Their complexion was like that of a rotting fish:[8] pallid yellow skin with patches of green, slimy scales and bony protrusions.[1][3] Their piscine eyes were similarly devoid of life with deep,[1] black pupils surrounded by red.[3] The weak-hearted were known to die upon gazing at sea hags, but fortunately they had long, limp, hair that resembled rancid seaweed, which often concealed their true forms.[2][3] Even without their squalid manes, sea hags could use illusory magic to disguise their appearance, although whatever form they took, they were cursed (or perhaps in their opinion, blessed) to appear ugly.[1] While all hags possessed an inverted sense of beauty, seeing it as ugly and vice versa, sea hags in particular were known for utterly abhorring all that was attractive. Many were filled with fury upon the sight of something beautiful and swiftly attempted to break it, but were more likely to take a corruptive approach to expressing their outrage. Rather than simply destroy the inspiring they would defile it so as to reverse its intended effect, turning symbols of hope into figures of despair, icons of courage into images of dread and places of joy into dens of misery.[1][8] Sea hags themselves normally lived as gloomy recluses, in lairs as dismal as they were. As they watched others go about their lives, they began slowly bubbling with jealous rage until their hatred overflowed and they were compelled to release it. Sometimes wanderers would intrude upon their domains and give them a chance to vent, but they would just as easily exit their homes and hunt for victims, whether among the surface-dwellers or other aquatic entities.[9] A sea hag's greatest weapon was the sheer atrocity that was their appearance, for just looking upon a sea hag could inspire fright so overwhelming that it sapped strength.[3] Even worse than laying eyes upon a sea hag was when a sea hag laid eyes on someone else, for their evil eye could have dire effects on those they glared at. If already horrified,[1] victims were at risk of, if not outright death, then paralysis or a simple dazed state, for several days.[2][3] While they could use their illusory disguise to avoid detection, it was only visual in nature and failed to hold up under close scrutiny.[1][3] When fighting, sea hags lacked subtle tactics beyond a simple ambush. They would hide or disguise themselves in an attempt to lure as many of their potential prey close before revealing themselves.[2][3] Whenever possible, sea hags used their horrific glare to render foes helpless and would consume the fallen victims as soon as possible.[3] Melee was considered a secondary tactic only to be used if the enemy was outnumbered and despite their claws they were known to prefer using daggers.[2][3] When undergoing ordinary forms of training they often became fighters or barbarians, otherwise becoming clerics.[7] The lake hag Maud Chiselbone and her will-o'-wisp companion making human stew. Sea hags were known to be solitary beings. They typically laired in bleak and befouled areas surrounded by underwater monsters and with nearby settlements. The verticality of their homes was generally irrelevant; they might inhabit sunken shipwrecks, polluted shores or slopes and cliffsides.[8][9] Around the lairs of powerful sea hags, such as grandmas or aunties, could have noticeable signs of their presence. Such indicators could be treacherous tides, a slick, slippery film of slime coating most surfaces, or an abundance of decaying fish corpses that the sea hag could speak through and sense the disturbance of. Within their lairs such hags would be even more dangerous, gaining abilities such as the power to create splotches of murky ink within it or the ability to create obedient simulacrums out of ooze, kelp, fish corpses and nebulous debris based on anyone inside the lair.[8] Some sea hags venerated Dagon as a deity.[10] Sea hags had their own language and spoke the language of annis hags.[3] They also often knew Common, Aquan, Giant[1] and the aquatic variant of Elven.[3] Sea hags, appropriately, were known to occupy warm seas in shallows with overgrown vegetation.[3] They were amphibious and swam faster than they walked.[1] Sea hags were said to have a maximum lifespan of approximately 800 years old, if not several millennia.[3][8] Sea hags could be found in the Sea of Fallen Stars, typically swimming at a depth between 150\u2012300\u202fft (46\u201291\u202fm).[9] Within the underwater caves of Skullport, sea hags dwelt in the husks of lost ships.[11] While less common and less magically resistant than their marine cousins, there existed a breed of freshwater sea hags. They made their homes in non-arctic bodies of water such as lakes but needed more light.[3][12] A greater sea hag There also existed a race of greater sea hags that, like freshwater sea hags, were far more rare. Some were indistinguishable from ordinary sea hags while others were larger, had greater charisma or possessed piscine lower halves. They were just as envious and suspicious as their ordinary kin and so rarely joined covens or reproduced, but often lived 200 years longer than they did.[13] They were just as hideous as their ordinary kin but their gaze served to enchant prey rather than kill them. They would take on the appearance of attractive beings like merfolk or nereids before luring ships into dangerous waters, causing the ship to sink. Afterwards, they would steal the treasures on board and devour the crew, adding flesh to their diet of grounded rock salt. They also possessed greater innate, magical ability and a rare few had psionic powers.[13] Ogre and hill giant myths told that the moon goddess Cegilune was the mother of the hag race and that sea hags were among the original types to have been wrought from her former worshipers.[14] However, some believed that greater sea hags were the descendants of more powerful beings created by the wicked Elemental Evil Princess of Elemental Water, Olhydra. The Princess, in turn, argued that lesser sea hags and possibly all hags were really the degenerate spawn of the superior, greater sea hags.[13]",

Against living creatures, shadows were very aggressive and quick to attack,[6] they were known to hesitate briefly when confronted with someone wearing a silkstone.[7] Their favored victims were innocent creatures, who lived morally good lives.[1] Their touch sapped the strength of living creatures.[3] They didn't need to do this to exist, for they entirely existed on negative energy, but they suffered from a craving for the strength of living creatures and if denied this too long, they were driven into a frenzy that made them charge enemies even if was detrimental for their long-term survival.[8] The touch of a shadow was painfully chilly and sapped the target's strength away. Every time they sapped the strength of their victim, the victim's shadow darkened. On death, the shadow split away, if the victim wasn't evil[1] and rose as a shadow enslaved to the killer.[3] As an incorporeal creature, a shadow could fly. It had acute senses and a shadow's normal strategy was to hide in a dark place and attack bypassing creatures.[6] While in dark areas, a shadow could hide away from view. and it could also move through cracks of only 1 inch width.[1] Shadows were encountered alone, in gangs of two to five or in swarms of six to eleven individuals.[6] They hid in dark places and attacked creatures who passed by.[6] Shadows could be found anywhere.[6] They hid from the sun in the depths of the world or within buried ruins and crypts.[citation needed] Beyond Toril, shadows could be found on the darkside of the planet Radole due to a gate to the Negative Material plane.[9] Beyond the Prime Material plane, shadows could be found in the Domains of Dread[10] and Palpitatia the 241st layer of the Abyss.[11] The drow deities Kiaransalee[12] and Vhaeraun were served by shadows, and they were sometimes sent by them to aid their followers.[13] Shadows were also known to serve Eshowdow of Chult, where they played a central role in the sinister rituals of the Eshowe.[14] Some clerics of Shar, known as Nightcloaks, were capable of summoning shadows to their aid.[15] Anastrianna Galanodel and her raven familiar Tillatal. Anastrianna Galanodel was an elven adventurer slain by a shadow some time after the Fall of Netheril. She became an emancipated spawn when the shadow was destroyed by her companions. In the Year of the Wan Shades, \u2212306 DR, she joined an army of similarly freed \"wan shades\" to strike against the many undead of Netheril.[16][17]",

Their bodies were stretched so that they resembled serpents with the head and hands on one end and the legs on the other, but otherwise they had nothing in common with serpents. There were only a few of these creatures. They dwelled in the east starwood area of the forest of Cormanthor, north of the Halfaxe Trail.[7] Shambling mounds were often found in temperate marshlands.[3] In northwest Faer\u00fbn, they could be found in the Mere of Dead Men[8] and the Stump Bog.[9] In interior Faer\u00fbn, they could be found in the Vast Swamp of Cormyr.[10] In south Faer\u00fbn, they could be found in the Great Swamp of Rethild,[11] occasionally in the Thornwood,[12], occasionally in Chondalwood,[13] and wandering the jungles of Samarach.[14] In 1357 DR[15] and up to 1368 DR, shambling mounds could occasionally be found in the sewers beneath Waterdeep.[16] In 1374 DR, the Shadowscale lizardfolk lured a shambling mound into the back entrance of their warren by bringing it animal carcasses. It served a dual purpose as both guardian and waste disposal. However, when they stopped feeding it (being undead, they no longer needed to eat), it went off and hunted on its own, but used the area as a den. Two shocker lizards joined it, forming a mutualist relationship: they gained the shambler's protection and ate its leavings, while their electric shocks bolstered and healed the shambler.[6]",

They looked something like a large stick figure made of wood with rocky appendages and metal parts.[3] Each shield guardian was keyed to a special magical amulet. If the amulet were destroyed, the guardian would cease to function until keyed to a replacement amulet. A replacement amulet could cost 1,000[1] to 20,000 gold pieces[3] depending on materials and the crafter, and took seven days to construct.[1] Whoever wore the amulet could control the shield guardian, and if the last wearer died, the guardian would obey its final orders to the best of its ability.[3] A shield guardian could not speak, but it could magically understand the commands of anyone controlling it through the amulet, no matter the speaker's language. Moreover, the wearer of the amulet could summon the shield guardian magically from anywhere within the same plane. Though the guardian might have some difficulty making the journey, it would always know the location of its amulet.[3] The default behavior of a shield guardian was to follow its master everywhere and protect him or her. If given other orders, it would do its best to obey, though it was not adept at solving problems. One could be programmed to perform certain tasks at certain times or in response to certain stimuli.[3] A shield guardian protected its master with great speed and agility, attempting to deflect blows and attacks. If commanded to, a shield guardian could generate a magical shield that would partially defend its master from harm, provided the master remained within 100 feet (30 meters) of the guardian. A shield guardian also acted similar to a ring of spell storing, being able to store a single spell that was cast upon and recast the same spell at a later time, provided it was commanded to do so.[3] A shield guardian offering a flower to a girl during the Day of Wonders parade in Waterdeep. A shield guardian was constructed from at least 5,000-gold pieces-worth of bronze, stone, steel, and wood and required skill in blacksmithing and carpentry. The magical amulet through which the construct was controlled usually cost between 1,000[1] and 20,000[3] gold pieces. The shield guardian could only be animated in the presence of the amulet, and the process required a special laboratory, knowledge of the art of crafting constructs, and an extended ritual that involved the casting of the spells discern location, limited wish, shield, and shield other.[3] After the war between the elves of Evereska and the phaerimms, shield guardians were used to guard the houses and mansions from intruders.[5] Likewise, the lake surrounding Herald's Hall was patrolled by shield guardians.[6][7] A shield guardian amulet.",

They were similar in appearance to violet fungi, but they lacked the ability to move and did not have tentacles with which to poison prey. They could produce a loud, piercing, screaming sound that tended to attract curious creature (or adventurers) to the area.[3] They were immune to the poison of violet fungi.[3] Shriekers could sense nearby motion or light and would respond with their namesake shriek. Each such screaming sound lasted between five and fifteen seconds. A patch of shriekers relied on violet fungi to kill prey with their poison, since a shrieker could not attack or move on its own. Like violet fungi, shriekers gained their nourishment from the breakdown of organic matter that had fallen nearby.[3] Two shrieker mushrooms. Shriekers thrived in dark underground environments.[3] Besides being found in large numbers in the Underdark, shriekers also grew on the illithid homeworld.[6] The Flooded Forest was a dark enough environment for shriekers to grow there as well.[7] In the Underdark, shriekers were sometimes placed intentionally to act as intruder alarms. House DeVir planted a shrieker among every fifth mushroom surrounding its compound to ward off potential attackers.[9] Shriekers were poisonous to most creatures as food; however, the stomachs of hook horrors had adapted to digest them without issue.[10] They were also known to be eaten by purple worms, shambling mounds,[11] and medusae.[8] Some considered their spores to be a vital ingredient in brewing a potion of plant control.[11] In Cormyr, mushroom hunters often glazed fairy caps with the fur of hedgehog shriekers, making the mushrooms fetch twice their normal price.[8] Around the 14th century DR, some time prior to 1367 DR, the Waymoot town of Minroe discovered the sub-species known as hedgehog shriekers.[12] They domesticated the fungi by feeding them a paste of beetle larvae and decayed choke creeper vines.[8] They became a staple in the town's gardens, acting as an alarm system against medusae. And the town's mushroom hunters often carried them into the region's medusae-infested caves. Over time this caused a decline in the nearby medusae population.[8][12]",

        "description": "   A silver dragon enjoyed the company of humans and elves so much that it would often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life. However, it should be noted that silvers, like all dragons, believed themselves the most superior creatures in the world. However, apart from the ability to fly, which they enjoyed greatly, they tended to prefer the physical forms of humanoids for everyday life.[9] An overview of silver dragon anatomy. The silver dragon was regal and statuesque.[4] At first glance, a silver dragon appeared very similar to a white dragon. The wings were more curved than a white's, however, and a silver had two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also had a beautiful frill that began at the top of its head and flowed all the way down its neck and body to the tip of its tail. The frill was silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They had two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also had a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which had the rough appearance of a goatee. They smelled like rain.[9] They were very intelligent, more so than most humans, extremely powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and had lifespans that could reach 4,200 years.[7] Unlike the gold and bronze dragons, the silver dragon did not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. Instead, it waited for others to ask them for help; They would attempt to right an injustice if they saw one, but they had no inclination to intentionally seek evil out and destroy it. Silver dragons were more interested in protecting the humans or elves that came to its care.[9] One unusual trait they had was the love of human dining;[4][9] moreover, they would use their alternate form ability to take part in large feasts. Like most metallic dragons, silvers did not enjoy combat, and were averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they were as deadly as any other dragon.[9] Silver dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a cone of freezing cold, similar to that of white dragons. The second was a cone of paralyzing gas.[4] Silver dragons were extremely rare and elusive, preferring to take the guise of kind and elderly humanoids or very attractive and young humanoids. They very much liked to associate with elves and humans, not necessarily because they preferred their company over other races, but because they tried to learn from the shorter-lived humans.[9] Most silvers grouped together in \"clans\", a loose organization of dragons who chose to live together as a family. Clans took communal responsibility for protecting and raising their wyrmlings. A senior member of the clan might act as a leader, but no true leader actually existed. Silver dragons did not feel the need for a strict social structure, since they were most content to live as honestly as possible.[9] Silver dragons' favored enemy were red dragons because these chromatic dragons were almost always evil and had a talent for destruction. Additionally, silvers and reds favored the same sort of terrain for lairs, which led to territorial disputes on top of having attitudes and philosophies at odds with the others.[9] Dragons could live for millennia, while humans only lived a few decades. This vast difference in time led to inherent psychological differences concerning time. Dragons tended to think things through for years at a time, using their razor-sharp intellects to hone a plan to perfection, solve incalculable puzzles, or other such things. Silver dragons, however, noted that humans were able to accomplish much in their short lifespans because of their ambitious drive for success. When a silver dragon could combine its own long-term perspective with a quick and ambitious attitude, the benefit was undeniable.[9] Some silver dragons served certain deities as servants, including Aerdrie Faenya, Arvoreen, Corellon, Eilistraee, Gaerdal Ironhand, Gorm Gulthyn, Labelas Enoreth, Moradin, Sehanine Moonbow, Torm, and Yondalla.[10] A silver dragon's lair was typically found within an icy mountain, with the main entrance only accessible by air. The lair itself was similar to the gold dragon's in its sophistication and design, although the silver dragon's lair tended to be far less intricate. A typical lair would contain a main entertaining area, a storage room, a vault, a sleeping chamber, study, library, shrine, and two clinic rooms where the dragon could offer help and protection to those who needed it. The lair would also have a concealed back entrance for use in emergencies.[citation needed] Silver dragons laid their eggs in a bed of snow.[citation needed] A newly hatched silver wyrmling had scales of a bluish gray, which changed to silver over time.[5] Silver wyrmlings were intelligent, kind, extremely curious, and adorable.[citation needed] As they matured, many silver dragons left their clans for long periods of time to live among nondragons. They tended to live for many years with the same group of humans or elves, having grown attached to them. As members of the family died, the silver dragon, grieved by the loss, often chose to stay with the family, remaining a true and loyal friend and champion through many generations. If the dragon felt comfortable enough around these nondragons, it might even decide to reveal its true self.[citation needed] Not actually a silver dragon in any case. During the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, a brainwashed Luna used shapechange to turn into a silver dragon and attacked her friends Vajra Valmeyjar, Kyriani Agrivar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright outside the House of the Moon.

[3] Like other undead, skeletons could be repelled or destroyed outright by priests like paladins and clerics.[3] The necromantic spell animate dead allowed spellcasters to create skeletons.[16] They could also spontaneously rise in locations saturated with evil or necromantic powers.[1]",

        "description": " This is a\nGood Article!   Deities known to employ solars as stewards included Corellon, Horus-Re, Ilmater, and Milil.[14] A solar had a deep, commanding voice.[2][3][4][5][6] Its human-like[3][4] body was muscular[2][3][4] and beautiful,[3][4] with skin of copper,[5][6] silver,[2] gold,[2] or other metallic coloration.[3][4] Its hair was bronze or metallic-colored as well.[3][4][5][6] Its large, gleaming double[5][6] wings were white[2][15] or coppery-gold,[5][6] and its eyes were as radiant topaz.[2][3][4][5][6] Solars stood about 9\u202ffeet (270\u202fcentimeters)[2][3][4] or 10\u202ffeet (300\u202fcentimeters)[5][6] tall and weighed about 500\u202fpounds (230\u202fkilograms).[2] Not all solars appeared like this, however. For example, the solars in Corellon's court appeared rather as androgynous elves in shining white robes.[16] Solars were powerful and influential entities, and only the most fearsome fiends could rival them for power.[2] Like planetars, solars could pray for and cast divine magical spells like the most powerful of clerics.[2][3][4][5][6] In addition to the magical powers common to all angels, solars had innate access to a wide range of powerful magics, for which they did not need to pray. These were too many to list entirely here, but they included such wondrous magics as the ability to grant wishes,[2][3][4][5][6] to restore victims from ailments,[1][2][3][4][5][6] and to resurrect the dead.[1][2][3][4][5][6] They could create a barrier of magical blades;[1][1][2] trigger a massive earthquake;[2][3][4][5][6] send waves of exhaustion over their enemies;[2] charm large groups of monsters at the same time;[2] make the effects of certain spells permanent;[2][3][4][5][6] blind, stun, or kill with only a single word;[2][3][4][5][6] and damage enemies with a prismatic spray.[2][3][4][5][6] Solars could make themselves invisible,[1][2][3][4][5][6] commune directly with their deity,[1][2][3][4][5][6][12] and control the weather.[1][2][3][4][5][6] By touching a mortal, a solar could grant the ability for that creature to survive in any environment for up to 100 years.[3][4][5][6] A solar bearing his traditional weapons. A solar could emit a searing burst of holy, magical energy to burn away its enemies, and its gaze could strike blindness in its foes.[1] Solars sometimes summoned the aid of other celestial beings.[2][3][4][5][6] Those of lawful good philosophies tended to favor summoning ki-rin. Neutral good solars favored phoenixes, while chaotic good solars chose titans. They were also known to gate in planetars or devas.[3][4][5][6] They bore all of the same immunities and resistances of other angels and were surrounded by the same protective aura of good.[2][3][4][5][6] Furthermore, they could only be permanently harmed by magically evil attacks from the most epic of foes;[2][3][4][5][6] they could regenerate from any other injuries.[2][3][4][5][6] Like planetars, solars could see in the dark and in low-light,[2][5][6] and they always saw things as they truly were,[1][2] being able to see invisible and shapechanged creatures and objects,[2][3][4][5][6] hidden traps,[2][3][4][5][6] and evil auras.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Solars could even see into the ultraviolet spectrum to a visual range of 300\u202fyards (270\u202fmeters).[17] They could always sense when someone was lying.[1][2] Older scholars even attributed certain psionic abilities to the solars.[5][6] Solars could take to the wing at immense speeds with good maneuverability, and were swift of foot as well.[1][2][3][4] Beyond these physical means of movement, they could teleport short distances.[1][5][6] Solars, like all other angels, could use magic to speak any language,[2][5][6] They could also communicate telepathically within 120\u202ffeet (37\u202fmeters).[1][5][6] As with other angels, solars were always good in outlook, but some leaned more toward law and others more toward freedom,[2][3][4][5][6] though perhaps more commonly the former case was true.[1] They were unmovable in their loyalty toward both their divine masters and their alignment.[5][6] They truly were the epitome of such virtues as devotion, honor, and purity.[12] A solar about to nock a slaying arrow. Solars had immense fighting prowess complemented by their magical angelic greatswords as well as by composite longbows that allowed the solar to enchant any arrow as a slaying arrow when nocked.[1][2][3][4][5][6] These bows were known as bows of the solars.[18] Their magical greatswords could hover in the air and fight by will of the solar's mind alone, falling only if the solar were destroyed.[1][3][4][5][6] Later scholars believed that there were only ever 24 solars in existence in the multiverse.[1] Earlier scholars had instead used that figure as the minimum value.[5][6][note 1] Solars resided in the Upper Planes,[10] including Mount Celestia, Bytopia, Elysium, the Beastlands, and Olympus.[7][9] Solars could travel to any of the planes of existence but only when directed to by the powers,[5][6] and this was a very rare occurrence.[12] Perhaps once in several millennia, they might be called upon to lead armies of other angels in battle against the fiends. More likely, they were sent on missions of great import, yet which most mortals would not find interesting.[12] When not called into service, solars maintained a state of restful contemplation, awaiting the call to the service of good.[1] Solars were created from the ascendancy of planetars as a reward of the gods that they served.[8][19] Ascension was voluntary, but such an offer of promotion to so high an order as a solar was exceptionally rare.[19] Similarly, solars who failed to serve the cause of good could lose their powers and be reduced to a lesser form of angel. In the most extreme of cases, they are considered \"fallen\" and were exiled from the Upper Planes, stripped of their innate powers.[20] As outsiders, solars were not dependent upon their environment for survival. They did not need to eat, drink, or sleep.[21] Solars were truly immortal beings and did not die of old age.[8] In fact, as with other aasimon, solars could not be permanently slain unless on their home plane. If their bodies were destroyed anywhere else, their life forces would return to their home plane, where their bodies would reform over a period of 70 years.[3][4][5][6] On occasion, rather than returning to the form of a solar, the spirit would be changed into a light aasimon.[12] On rare occasions where a solar would take a mortal lover, his or her aasimar descendants would often have silvery or golden skin, bright topaz-colored eyes, or the traces of white feathers at the shoulder, as evidence of the celestial heritage.[22] In the Dawn Ages, circa \u221230,000 DR, the solar Malkizid was cast down to the Nine Hells.[23] An artist's depiction of the solar Zariel before her fall to evil.",

They looked much as they did in life, though the injuries that caused their violent deaths were visible on many specimen and could be recognized by someone who knew what the person looked like.[3] They were about the same size as a humanoid but weightless.[3] They had a hatred for all living things but retained their minds and capability to think.[3] A specter's touch wasn't only painful; it also drained the life energy from living creatures. The life energy had an invigorating effect on specters, and when the life energy of a creature was drained empty, the creature\u2014only in the case of a humanoid\u2014turned into a new specter enslaved by its creator.[3] As a general rule, they attacked their prey by moving through solid objects, including walls, ceilings, or even the ground.[3] They were generally encountered in a number of less than a dozen.[3] They were powerless in natural sunlight to the point of fleeing from it.[3] A specter was a type of undead that was categorized as a spectral creature. When someone tried to create a spectral creature out of a humanoid, instead of another sort of creature, the result was a specter. Unlike humanoid specters, other spectral creatures were capable of creating and enslaving other spectral creatures, or specters,[6] out of other lifeforms than humanoids.[3] The shadow dragons of Clan Jaezred conquered the drow city of Chaulssin and transformed its citizens into creatures of shadow,[7] among others spectral creatures.[8] Given that drow were humanoids,[9] the results were specters.[10] By 634 DR, the descendants of these drow overthrew their slavers and killed them. The shadow dragons were then turned into spectral creatures themselves.[7] These drow descendants later succeeded at turning some of them into drow-dragons.[11] A special kind of magic they mastered was to turn their breath weapon into one that created spectral creatures on killing their target with it.[12] Used on humanoids, it created a specter.[10] Beyond the Prime Material plane, spectres could be found in the Domains of Dread,[13] Palpitatia the 241st layer of the Abyss,[14] the Shadowfell,[citation needed] and in the Negative Energy plane.[citation needed] In Cormanthyr, the specters of many elves and dwarves haunted the ruins of the Old Elven Court.[15] A specter-haunted place and the vicinity of a specter was cold, though in no harmful way.[3] Animals also refused to get into the vicinity of a specter and suffered from uncontrollable fear when forced to go near one.[3] Being a type of undead connected to negative energy, specters acted as servants of the deities Jergal[16] and Kiaransalee.[17]",

Spiders inhabited the forest known as the Neth Stand.[20] Adhe Wood in the Vast was infested with ettercaps and mutant spiders of many sizes and breeds.[21] Spiders were common in the Underdark, particularly in drow settlements, where they were revered by worshipers of Lolth.[22] Drow often made objects and buildings in the shape of spiders.[23][24] In cultures that venerated Lolth, it was forbidden to kill a spider; those who did so were punished with death.[25] Spiders were often kept by the drow, their purpose depending on a given spider's size. The smallest ones were kept as pets by children. Those that were big enough to kill mice, meaning hand-sized, were kept as familiars by wizards. Those that were as big as a horse were used to ride upon. Those that were the size of dogs were used like guard dogs in temples to Lolth. The last category were sometimes imbued with a demon to make older ones regain their vitality, combining it with a nasty personality.[26] Spriggans in the Feywild were sometimes known to use spiders to create web barriers in their forests.[27]",

        "description": "   They had a human female head on a snake body. Spirit nagas had serpentine bodies with black scales and red bands. Their humanoid faces were framed with stringy hair.[2] The average spirit naga was 15 feet long and weighed about 300 pounds.[4] The spirit nagas emitted stench of carrion, making them look as foul as they smell.[8] Which was very appropriate for their favorite meal was rotting flesh.[4] Some if not all spirit nagas possessed the ability to shapeshift to a human or demihuman bodies but disliked humanoid forms, preferring the advantage of a tail.[9] Spirit nagas' blood was quite acidic and, when spilled, the blood emitted hissing sizzling sound, the telltale sign of its corrosive quality.[7] They were even more mysterious and enigmatic than the others of their kind, seeking lost magic to a fanatical extent. They saw only evil, ugliness, and they delighted in causing suffering and death with the powers they possessed.[10] Spirit nagas were powerful spellcasters. The bite of a spirit naga was deadly, as it contained venom. The eyes of the creature were no better, as their gaze could cause others to fall under the control of the naga. These nagas come back to life just a few days after their death, making them virtually immortal, this ability could only be stopped via wish spell.[1] Spirit nagas were cunning creatures preferring spells and traps often attacking without warning.[4] Spirit nagas preferred solitude or ruling over lower creatures, being worshiped in cults.[11] In Chult, spirit nagas often took on the role of chieftain over pterafolk tribes.[12] A spirit naga as depicted in Dungeon Hack. Most nagas respected culture and lore and considered it to be a worthy goal to preserve it, leading them to claim homes in ruins of ancient civilizations long gone. Even vile and evil spirit nagas that loved destruction established lairs in lost cities, temples, or castles (sometimes that they themselves brought to ruin).[11] Ha-nagas were massive and powerful naga lords and often worshiped by spirit nagas as gods.[13] Nagas were created via magical inbreeding by the sarrukh early on in the era of Mhairshaulk. By \u201324000 DR, Mhairshaulk has been in decline and the nagas have almost completely abandoned their homeland spreading all around Faer\u00fbn. In the following millennia, nagas naturally branched and evolved into numerous naga species, including spirit nagas.[8] Some spirit nagas unearthed ancient rituals of their creators transforming themselves into powerful being called ha-nagas.[8] In 1372 DR spirit nagas were a recent addition to the city of Najara. A dozen spirit nagas served the King of Najara as protectors of the royal line.[14] In 1373 DR, a foul spirit naga was encountered in one of the frozen caverns up in the Sunrise Mountains.[7]",

        "description": "   The term \"sprite\" actually had two meanings: the first meant the specific race of tiny warriors, while the second use referred to the group of tiny, insect-featured fey that the specific kind belonged to.[2] Sprites resembled tiny, elven-featured fey with insect-like wings. They were about 2\u202ffeet (0.61\u202fmeters) tall.[2] Sprites were flighty and found most other creatures too serious. However, they also despised evil.[2] Because of their austerity and zealous attitude against evil, sprites were considered overly sullen and harsh by other fey. Unlike pixies, they did not care to engage in fun activities or adorn themselves. However, they were excellent judges of character, and could always sense another creature's real nature and emotions. They were quick to ally with good-natured creatures, and would come to their aid even at unexpected times.[1] Like other fey, sprites possessed several innate magical powers: they could become invisible at will and could detect good or evil from 50\u202fyards (46\u202fmeters) away.[2] Sprites were expert brewers of toxins, poisons, and antidotes. In particular, they favored a potent sleep poison with which they coated their arrows. They usually harvested the ingredients for these toxins in forests, even venturing into dangerous areas to find them, but were not above stealing some from hags' gardens if extremely necessary.[1] Sprites made their homes by meadows and glades deep within thriving forests. They were omnivorous creatures who, unlike most of their kin, were mainly active during the day.[2] Sprites' villages could also be found inside the trunks of trees or treants. They allowed no trespassers, and were quick to judge the moral character of persisting invaders.[1] Cormanthyr[5] and the Far Forest were some of many locations on the Faer\u00fbn that sprites were known to inhabit.[6] In the Unapproachable East, sprites could be found around the woodlands of Aglarond. Including the grassy meadow known as Halendos.[7] Beyond Faer\u00fbn, sprites could be found on Evermeet, where they acted as protectors of glades and meadows. They were the only race of fey known to have regular contact with the island's elves.[8] In the Moonshae Isles, sprites lived in the kingdom of Sarifal and the Llyrath Forest on Gwynneth Isle.[9] Beyond the Prime Material plane, some sprites could be found in the Elemental Plane of Air.[10] Sprites kept an eye on other small sprite-like fey, either to protect them or to know who to invite to their gatherings. They were also known to associate with druids and the occasional ranger.[2] Sprites were one of the many fey races known to serve the Seldarine.[11]",

They considered the elven empire of Myth Drannor shortly before its fall to be the pinnacle of civilized history and strove to recreate the world in that image.[7]\nContents\nHistory\nFirst Reformation\nSecond Reformation\nCorruption of the Harper King\nThird Reformation\nTime of Troubles & Harper Schism\nFourth Reformation\nMembership\nRegions\nWaterdeep\nRelationships\nHarper Code\n\"What it is to be a Harper...\"\nNotable Harpers\nFormer Harpers\nAppendix\nNotes\nAppearances\nFurther Reading\nReferences\nConnections\nHistory\nThose Who Harp have disbanded several times, but after each time they eventually reformed one way or another.[8]\nThe idea behind the Harpers was first conceived by several Myth Drannan elven military leaders in collusion with a few trusted human rangers and druids.[9] The mage Dathlue Mistwinter agreed to lead such a group in the Year of Freedom's Friends, 324 DR[5] at the head of a council that also included a (relatively) young Elminster Aumar. They took for their symbol Mistwinter's family crest\u2014a silver harp between the horns of a crescent moon\u2014and met at twilight at secret locations in the Elven Court, earning them their moniker: the Harpers at Twilight.[9]\nHowever, the Harpers at Twilight dwindled in number over the next four centuries, victims of attrition at the hands of their enemies: bandits, slavers, drow, illithids, orcs, and evil spellcasters attracted to Myth Drannor's success.[9] The Weeping War decimated the remaining members of the group. By the end of the conflict, Dathlue was dead[10] as were all but about a dozen of the Harpers at Twilight.[11]\nFirst Reformation\nOn the 27th of Flamerule of 720 DR, at a druid grove in High Dale called the Dancing Place, a large congregation of dryads arrived when dusk fell earlier than it should have and a bright moon shone when no moon should have been visible. The dryads bid the druids make welcome the priests of many different gods who started to arrive before finally Elminster appeared to explain why they had all been called.[10]\nThe elves had called for the support of the priests assembled to help fight back against the faithful of Bane, Bhaal, Loviatar, Malar, and Myrkul, who were coming from the south and attacking the elves and performing abhorrent deeds.[10] The priests argued but their deities\u2014Corellon, Mielikki, Mystra, Oghma, Sel\u00fbne, Silvanus, and Tymora\u2014directly possessed them and spoke through them, voicing their support in person and extending their blessings to this effort.[6][11] This night thusly became known as the Gathering of the Gods.[11]\nThe remaining Harpers at Twilight set about recruiting new members and expanding their influence, though they did so very slowly and lost around twenty new recruits to conflict with their enemies.[11] Over that time though, these new Harpers established an incredibly effective information network, and earned the respect of religious leaders by using that network to help their causes. In return, they were granted the use of fortified temples and monasteries wherein members could train and recuperate between missions.[12]\nIt was during this period, known as the \"Long Years\" within the organization,[11] that the Harpers erected the wards around Hellgate Keep[13] and helped to kill Sammaster.[14] The Harpers' increasingly public actions also made them come into more frequent conflict with the Church of Bane and the nation of Thay. When the Harpers eradicated the Wearers of the Skull and thereby attracted the ire of the Church of Myrkul, who sent liches after the Harpers, only to see each destroyed, Thay then raised armies to hunt them down and the remaining Harpers went underground in 1021 DR.[12][note 1]\nIn the Year of the Watching Helm, 992 DR[15][note 2] the Harpers founded the Heralds of Faer\u00fbn to prevent the unscrupulous from blaming others for their misdeeds. The Heralds also used their power to provide Harpers with cover identities.[12]\nSecond Reformation\nAfter the loss of many members during the previous year, Elminster and Khelben Arunsun decided in 1022 DR that new recruits were needed and that the revitalized Harpers would be an \"underground army of adventurers\".[16] Recruits who met the pair's standards took time to be found, but eventually Elminster happened upon the Wanderers of Espar, a band of a dozen bards, druids, and rangers led by Finder Wyvernspur and Ulzund Hawkshield in Cormyr. Through a series of manipulations, these adventurers were introduced to surviving Harper veterans and ended up successfully battling many of the Harper's enemies.[16]\nThe group continued to be quietly manipulated by Elminster and Khelben, who appointed certain members as \"Master Harpers\" and supplied them with harper pins while the sisters Dove and Storm Silverhand posed as traveling minstrels to attract new members with their music.[17]\nOver the next two centuries, the Harpers re-established their information network but were drawn into ever more public fights with evil churches, the Cult of the Dragon, Thay, and others.[18] Casualties began to mount again and to avoid a repeat of history, Khelben and Elminster had all senior Harpers go into hiding.[19] By this time, however, Finder Wyvernspur became corrupted and the Harpers sealed him in the Citadel of White Exile.[18] In the Year of the Empty Scabbard, 1116 DR, seeing the Harpers no better than cultists of Bane, the Heralds decided that they could not be openly associated with the Harpers and split from them.[18][20]\nWhen junior members grew tired of the new, low-key direction the group was headed in and started getting themselves killed in foolish fights, Elminster gave them a direction\u2014by starting the Harpstar Wars.[19] Only around forty of the Harpers involved in the war survived it and when they returned, they found their organization had strayed in a completely different direction.[21]\nCorruption of the Harper King\nA Harper bard named Rundorl Moonsklan had convinced himself that Elminster, Khelben, and the Harpers they'd taken with them during the Harpstar Wars had gotten themselves killed fighting on other planes and that senior Harpers in hiding had actually permanently retired. His ambition, therefore, was to replace the organization's leadership and reshape it to his own ends. He desired to be the power behind every throne in the North and happened to meet Szass Tam while planning on how to achieve this.[21]\nThe two came to an agreement: Szass Tam would funnel Rundorl information on his rivals in Thay and Rundorl would gain prestige by concocting a story of a new spell capable of turning thousands into undead slaves with a single casting. The plan went perfectly, Rundorl led his fellows into battle against those whom he claimed had knowledge of \"the spell of Undeath\" and both he and Tam advanced in power.[22]\nEventually, though, more Harpers were dying than Thayans and Rundorl led a reluctant retreat out of Thay. His exhausted men were being assassinated and reanimated as undead, however, and Rundorl rightly suspected that Tam had betrayed him. Rundorl appealed to another lich named Thavverdasz. He promised the Harpers' services in return for his help defeating his reanimated comrades. Thavverdasz agreed, mockingly taking for himself the name \"Harper King\" after learning of Rundorl's ambition. The undead were easily wrested from Tam's control but Thavverdasz betrayed his other allies, the Cult of the Dragon.[22]\nIt was this situation that the surviving Harpstar veterans returned to in 1222 DR. The Cult of the Dragon had raised an army and sent it against Thavverdasz's Harpers while Szass Tam challenged the Harper King directly. Thavverdasz used a powerful magic item to defeat Tam, but Elminster surprised and assassinated the Harper King shortly thereafter.[23]\nGrimly, Storm and Dove set about replacing their massive losses while Khelben and the remaining veterans licked their wounds. Elminster was left to counter the rising star of the Zhentarim alone, beginning a long-standing feud with Manshoon. He pulled strings among the Wychlaran to keep the Thayans busy and turned the lair of the Harper King into a deathtrap to destroy the inevitable Cult of the Dragon reinforcements. Luckily, the Harper information network remained intact and largely ignorant of the organization's recent corruption.[23]\nThird Reformation\nStorm Silverhand came to lead the so-called \"eastern branch\" of the Harpers. These senior members operated mostly in the lands east and north of the Dalelands and were based, unofficially, in Shadowdale.[24] When Alustriel Silverhand rose to power in Silverymoon in 1235 DR,[25] after three years of chaos since Sepur of Silverymoon abandoned the city,[26] Alustriel and her followers were aided by her sister Storm's Harpers against the orcs of the Black Horde and the mage Shaloss Ethenfrost.[27] In return for their help, Storm was allowed to build Moongleam Tower in Everlund.[24]\nKhelben led the Harpers on the Sword Coast over the next century but sponsored the Harpstar veteran Cylyria Dragonbreast in her bid to become High Lady of Berdusk in 1321 DR, giving over leadership of his Harpers to her. Cylyria's Order of the Silver Moon and Harp was much more regimented than the eastern branch, who functioned much like they always had since the Harper King was destroyed. This also freed up Khelben for other things, like rescuing Laeral Silverhand from the Crown of Horns in 1357 DR. The Harpers of Twilight Hall, as they were colloquially known, acted openly against the Zhentarim and Amnian interests and even came close to crippling the Rundeen,[24] which brought open hostilities against Berdusk itself. The move also brought many volunteers who wanted to join the Harpers however, swelling their ranks with new members.[28]\nTime of Troubles & Harper Schism\nMain articles: Time of Troubles and Harper schism\nThe Time of Troubles of 1358 DR caused many deaths in the Harpers but its aftermath saw the return of Finder Wyvernspur and his rise to godhood, as well as a massive disruption among the Zhentarim, which brought enough of a reprieve for the Harpers to replace their losses.[28]\nThe Harpers were not safe from strife, however. In 1370 DR, investigators discovered evidence that implicated Khelben in the theft of an artifact, the Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings, which had then found its way into the hands of the Zhentarim. Khelben admitted to all of the charges against him, and he and Laeral both left the Harpers,[29][30][31] as did Alustriel (who felt she could not commit to the Harpers as the leader of Luruar)[29] and many of Khelben's closest friends and allies, founding their own group: the Moonstars.[31]\nThe government of Waterdeep refused to help the Harpers of Twilight Hall prosecute Khelben so they proceeded to ward Harper stores against Khelben and Laeral, while Khelben erected a ward that prevented any Harper from approaching Blackstaff Tower. Influenced by Bran Skorlsun, the Harpers of Twilight Hall went on a witch hunt to purge their ranks of perceived traitors while Storm's eastern branch tried to carry on with their business regardless of events in the west.[29]\nFourth Reformation\nThe Harpers were overwhelmed by the Spellplague of 1385 DR and the ensuing chaos of the Wailing Years. Many died, others vanished, and those who survived were cut off from one another, so they focused solely on the perils that menaced their homes and neighbors.[8] While the original organization was divided and its members scattered across the continent, the hope of returning the Harpers to their former glory didn't die.[32]\nOne bastion of Harper strength remained, however: Moongleam Tower was run by Eaerlraun Shadowlyn, who tried to keep the Harper ideals alive and around 1419 DR refounded the group as the \"Harpers of Luruar\" to secretly counter the forces of Netheril.[1] Following the example of the Harpers of Luruar, other Harper cells began to operate again throughout the Realms. Some of these groups were clearly new organizations that adopted the name and some of the ideals of the Harpers of old, while others were groups of Harpers that had survived the fall of the organization during the Spellplague but had gone underground and now returned to action,[33] such as the \"Harpers of Waterdeep\" and the \"Harpers of Cormyr and the Dales\", led by Storm Silverhand, which many felt were the spiritual successors of the original Harpers.[32]\nSeveral other groups who called themselves Harpers appeared in the following years. The \"Harpers of Athkatla\" worked against the Council of Five and other Amnian authorities, but although they claimed to share the ideals of the Harpers of old, they didn't and merely claimed to to gain support. The \"Harpers of Selgaunt\" and the \"Harpers of Ormpur\" were also rebels who did not really cleave to Harper ideals.[33]\nThese new Harpers brought with them enemies of their own, such as the Abolethic Sovereignty, Szass Tam's Thay, the Zhentarim, and the Warlock Knights of Vaasa.[32]\nBy 1475 DR, the \"Harpers of Luruar\" had managed the cripple the efforts of the Netherese in significant ways.[8] Unfortunately, Eaerlraun was killed by shadovar assassins and the Harpers were forced to act in complete secrecy to prevent the loss of more members.[1]\nIn 1478 DR, the Harpers of Waterdeep were led by a Harper agent known as \"the Fisher\", who was actually a double agent working for the Zhentarim to undermine Harper operations. Although Tam Zawad and other Harpers were able to bring the Fisher to justice, he had done great damage to the Harpers of Waterdeep. By 1486 DR, Zawad was still dealing with corrupt Harpers within his Harper cell.[32]\nThe \"Harpers of Neverwinter\" also suffered a devastating blow in 1479 DR. One of their high-ranking members, Cymril, was helping the Sons of Alagondar to oppose the rule of Dagult Neverember. However, an ambush by Mintarn Mercenaries resulted in her death, and in the revelation that she was also working for Neverember.[34] After her treachery was revealed, the reputation of the Harpers of Neverwinter was greatly damaged in the region, at least for a time.[35]\nIn the time of Mystra's Return,[36] Storm Silverhand began to revitalize the Harper organization in Cormyr. She sought out people from all walks of life: smiths, merchants, leather workers, and even those who worked in brothels. Her revitalizing actions were known and tolerated by the War Wizards of Cormyr.[37] The Harpers prevented the assassination of King's Lord Lothan Durncaskyn who was sheltering Mirt's lady, Rensharra Ironstave.[38]\nWhen the Cult of the Dragon tried to bring the goddess Tiamat to the Material Plane, circa 1487 DR, the Harpers were one of the many factions who rose up to oppose Tiamat's attempt at freedom. Since then, the Harpers became an active organization across the Realms again.[39]\nMembership\nHarpers could be of any age or profession, any sex or gender, and of any race. Humans, elves, and half-elves were most common among them, but a few gnomes, halflings, and dwarves, and even woodland folk like dryads and centaurs also joined. Most members were either rangers or bards, though wizards, rogues, fighters and clerics were also present. Priests could follow any faith; Azuth, Deneir, Eldath, Lliira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Sel\u00fbne, Silvanus, Tymora, and the Seldarine. This caused no issues of faith, though there was some friction with upper ranks of clergy. Druids, particularly of the North, tended to their willing allies rather than members.[40]\nThe Harpers were led by a council of High Harpers, who were responsible for most of the group's long-term plans and goals.[8][3] High Harpers were elected through the means of secret ballots among the other High Harpers, with the criteria being long-term service and extreme discretion in the implementation of their plans.[3]\nRegions\nThe Harpers operated mainly in north Faer\u00fbn, along the Sword Coast, the Western Heartlands, and the Dalelands.[41] The group itself was extremely decentralized and the nearest thing they had to a base of operations was Twilight Hall in Berdusk. An often-employed means of achieving their goals was assisting adventurers who were on quests that would further Harper interests.[3]\nIn the 15th century DR, the Harpers became active across all of Faer\u00fbn.[32]\nWaterdeep\nMain article: Waterdeep\nDue to the influence of the Moonstars, the Harpers had a relatively small amount of influence within the City of Splendors around 1372 DR. They had roughly 120 members at any time within the city's walls.[4]\nRelationships\nMany gods supported the organization of the Harpers: the churches of Azuth, Deneir, Eldath, Lliira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Sel\u00fbne, Shaundakul, Shiallia, Silvanus, Tymora, and the entire Seldarine all contributed clerics to become members of the Harpers and many of these also lent divine aid to the members of the group on a regular basis.[10] This could cause tensions between individual clerics of different faiths but never between deities or between the society as a whole and deities.[40] The drow goddess Eilistraee was among the good deities who looked kindly on Those Who Harp,[42][43] while they in turn supported her church on the surface.[44]\nPowerful individuals supported the Harpers, but equally powerful forces opposed them. Among these were the likes of the Dark Dagger, the malaugrym, the Rundeen, the Eldreth Veluuthra, the Twisted Rune, the Knights of the Shield, the Iron Throne, the Cult of the Dragon, the Red Wizards of Thay, the Zhentarim, and many of the churches of dark gods, in particular the revived church of Bane.[45][3]\nHarper Code\n\u201c\nHarpers work against villainy and wickedness wherever they find it, but they work ever mindful of the consequences of what they do.\nAll beings should walk free of fear, with the right to live their lives as they wish.\nThe rule of law aids peace and fosters freedom, so long as the laws are just and those who enforce them lenient and understanding.\nNo extreme is good. For freedom to flourish, all must be in balance: the powers of realms, the reaches of the cities and the wilderlands into each other, and the influence of one being over another.\nWhatever it takes, a Harper will do. Pride never rules the deeds of a true Harper.\nFreedom is a multiversal right, though Harpers can spare themselves less freedom than those they work to protect when the need presents itself.\nHarpers police their own. A Harper who hears the call of personal power can no longer hear the sweet song of the harp. A Harper who seizes power, and holds it above all else, is a traitor to the harp. Traitors must die for freedom to live.\nWithout a past, no being can appreciate what they have, and where they may be going.\n\u201d\n\"What it is to be a Harper...\"\n\u201c\n\"Right, then, good Lady Shandril, I shall try to tell thee something of what it is to be a Harper.\n\"A Harper holds peaceful sharing of the lands above all other goals.\n\"By sharing, we mean all the races living in and under the land, where each prefers to live, trading together where desire and need stir them to, and respecting each other's holds and ways\u2014without the daily bloodletting that all too often holds sway in the Realms today.\n\"True, we must fight, it seems often enough to keep our swords and our tempers both sharp enough. Yet, know ye; all of us fight when we must, or die. Moreover, ye only hear of blades drawn and death and spells hurled, and never know of the many, many times that a quiet word or a skillful deal has turned enemies aside from each other, forced a way clear where none was before, or distracted foes from the eager task of tearing each other's throats out. That is the true Harper way: subtle and quiet, behind the shouting. Trust and wisdom, and outfoxing others is what we deal in.\"\n\u201d\n\u2014 Mirt the Moneylender explaining the Harper's purpose to Shandril Shessair[46]\nNotable Harpers\nArilyn Moonblade\nAnsal Bloodshoulder\nArtus Cimber[47]\nBelhuar Thantarth\nBran Skorlsun\nBrenna Graycloak\nCaledan Caldorien\nDahl Peredur\nDanilo Thann\nDove Falconhand\nDrogan Droganson\nElminster Aumar\nFinder Wyvernspur\nGalvin\nGaraele\nGlarasteer Rhauligan\nHero of Daggerford: the hero who stopped the Zhentarim plan of taking over Daggerford via a puppet leader in 1372 DR.[48]\nJaheira\nKhalid\nKrowen Valharrow\nMattrim Mereg[49]\nMari Al'maren\nMintiper Moonsilver\nMira Zawad\nMirt the Moneylender[50]\nNymmestra Durothil\nOlive Ruskettle\nRemallia Haventree[51]\nRenaer Neverember[51]\nRuha\nSharalyn Lockleaf: the harper agent who opposed the Order of the Crippled Fang and Maganus in 1373 DR.[48]\nTam Zawad\nTennora Hedare\nWynter\nZelraun Roaringhorn\nZespara Alather\nFormer Harpers\nGorion: Retired from the Harpers to raise Abdel Adrian.\nKhelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun: Expelled from the organization in 1370 DR for making secret deals with Fzoul Chembryl, the leader of the Zhentarim, over the stolen Scepter of the Sorcerer Kings.

The Harpers, or Those Who Harp, were a semi-secret organization dedicated to promoting good, preserving history (including art and music of old), and maintaining a balance between civilization and nature by keeping kingdoms small and the destruction of animal and plant life to a minimum. They considered the elven empire of Myth Drannor shortly before its fall to be the pinnacle of civilized history and strove to recreate the world in that image.[7] Those Who Harp have disbanded several times, but after each time they eventually reformed one way or another.[8] The idea behind the Harpers was first conceived by several Myth Drannan elven military leaders in collusion with a few trusted human rangers and druids.[9] The mage Dathlue Mistwinter agreed to lead such a group in the Year of Freedom's Friends, 324 DR[5] at the head of a council that also included a (relatively) young Elminster Aumar. They took for their symbol Mistwinter's family crest\u2014a silver harp between the horns of a crescent moon\u2014and met at twilight at secret locations in the Elven Court, earning them their moniker: the Harpers at Twilight.[9] However, the Harpers at Twilight dwindled in number over the next four centuries, victims of attrition at the hands of their enemies: bandits, slavers, drow, illithids, orcs, and evil spellcasters attracted to Myth Drannor's success.[9] The Weeping War decimated the remaining members of the group. By the end of the conflict, Dathlue was dead[10] as were all but about a dozen of the Harpers at Twilight.[11] On the 27th of Flamerule of 720 DR, at a druid grove in High Dale called the Dancing Place, a large congregation of dryads arrived when dusk fell earlier than it should have and a bright moon shone when no moon should have been visible. The dryads bid the druids make welcome the priests of many different gods who started to arrive before finally Elminster appeared to explain why they had all been called.[10] The elves had called for the support of the priests assembled to help fight back against the faithful of Bane, Bhaal, Loviatar, Malar, and Myrkul, who were coming from the south and attacking the elves and performing abhorrent deeds.[10] The priests argued but their deities\u2014Corellon, Mielikki, Mystra, Oghma, Sel\u00fbne, Silvanus, and Tymora\u2014directly possessed them and spoke through them, voicing their support in person and extending their blessings to this effort.[6][11] This night thusly became known as the Gathering of the Gods.[11] The remaining Harpers at Twilight set about recruiting new members and expanding their influence, though they did so very slowly and lost around twenty new recruits to conflict with their enemies.[11] Over that time though, these new Harpers established an incredibly effective information network, and earned the respect of religious leaders by using that network to help their causes. In return, they were granted the use of fortified temples and monasteries wherein members could train and recuperate between missions.[12] It was during this period, known as the \"Long Years\" within the organization,[11] that the Harpers erected the wards around Hellgate Keep[13] and helped to kill Sammaster.[14] The Harpers' increasingly public actions also made them come into more frequent conflict with the Church of Bane and the nation of Thay. When the Harpers eradicated the Wearers of the Skull and thereby attracted the ire of the Church of Myrkul, who sent liches after the Harpers, only to see each destroyed, Thay then raised armies to hunt them down and the remaining Harpers went underground in 1021 DR.[12][note 1] In the Year of the Watching Helm, 992 DR[15][note 2] the Harpers founded the Heralds of Faer\u00fbn to prevent the unscrupulous from blaming others for their misdeeds. The Heralds also used their power to provide Harpers with cover identities.[12] After the loss of many members during the previous year, Elminster and Khelben Arunsun decided in 1022 DR that new recruits were needed and that the revitalized Harpers would be an \"underground army of adventurers\".[16] Recruits who met the pair's standards took time to be found, but eventually Elminster happened upon the Wanderers of Espar, a band of a dozen bards, druids, and rangers led by Finder Wyvernspur and Ulzund Hawkshield in Cormyr. Through a series of manipulations, these adventurers were introduced to surviving Harper veterans and ended up successfully battling many of the Harper's enemies.[16] The group continued to be quietly manipulated by Elminster and Khelben, who appointed certain members as \"Master Harpers\" and supplied them with harper pins while the sisters Dove and Storm Silverhand posed as traveling minstrels to attract new members with their music.[17] Over the next two centuries, the Harpers re-established their information network but were drawn into ever more public fights with evil churches, the Cult of the Dragon, Thay, and others.[18] Casualties began to mount again and to avoid a repeat of history, Khelben and Elminster had all senior Harpers go into hiding.[19] By this time, however, Finder Wyvernspur became corrupted and the Harpers sealed him in the Citadel of White Exile.[18] In the Year of the Empty Scabbard, 1116 DR, seeing the Harpers no better than cultists of Bane, the Heralds decided that they could not be openly associated with the Harpers and split from them.[18][20] When junior members grew tired of the new, low-key direction the group was headed in and started getting themselves killed in foolish fights, Elminster gave them a direction\u2014by starting the Harpstar Wars.[19] Only around forty of the Harpers involved in the war survived it and when they returned, they found their organization had strayed in a completely different direction.[21] A Harper bard named Rundorl Moonsklan had convinced himself that Elminster, Khelben, and the Harpers they'd taken with them during the Harpstar Wars had gotten themselves killed fighting on other planes and that senior Harpers in hiding had actually permanently retired. His ambition, therefore, was to replace the organization's leadership and reshape it to his own ends. He desired to be the power behind every throne in the North and happened to meet Szass Tam while planning on how to achieve this.[21] The two came to an agreement: Szass Tam would funnel Rundorl information on his rivals in Thay and Rundorl would gain prestige by concocting a story of a new spell capable of turning thousands into undead slaves with a single casting. The plan went perfectly, Rundorl led his fellows into battle against those whom he claimed had knowledge of \"the spell of Undeath\" and both he and Tam advanced in power.[22] Eventually, though, more Harpers were dying than Thayans and Rundorl led a reluctant retreat out of Thay. His exhausted men were being assassinated and reanimated as undead, however, and Rundorl rightly suspected that Tam had betrayed him. Rundorl appealed to another lich named Thavverdasz. He promised the Harpers' services in return for his help defeating his reanimated comrades. Thavverdasz agreed, mockingly taking for himself the name \"Harper King\" after learning of Rundorl's ambition. The undead were easily wrested from Tam's control but Thavverdasz betrayed his other allies, the Cult of the Dragon.[22] It was this situation that the surviving Harpstar veterans returned to in 1222 DR. The Cult of the Dragon had raised an army and sent it against Thavverdasz's Harpers while Szass Tam challenged the Harper King directly. Thavverdasz used a powerful magic item to defeat Tam, but Elminster surprised and assassinated the Harper King shortly thereafter.[23] Grimly, Storm and Dove set about replacing their massive losses while Khelben and the remaining veterans licked their wounds. Elminster was left to counter the rising star of the Zhentarim alone, beginning a long-standing feud with Manshoon. He pulled strings among the Wychlaran to keep the Thayans busy and turned the lair of the Harper King into a deathtrap to destroy the inevitable Cult of the Dragon reinforcements. Luckily, the Harper information network remained intact and largely ignorant of the organization's recent corruption.[23] Storm Silverhand came to lead the so-called \"eastern branch\" of the Harpers. These senior members operated mostly in the lands east and north of the Dalelands and were based, unofficially, in Shadowdale.[24] When Alustriel Silverhand rose to power in Silverymoon in 1235 DR,[25] after three years of chaos since Sepur of Silverymoon abandoned the city,[26] Alustriel and her followers were aided by her sister Storm's Harpers against the orcs of the Black Horde and the mage Shaloss Ethenfrost.[27] In return for their help, Storm was allowed to build Moongleam Tower in Everlund.[24] Khelben led the Harpers on the Sword Coast over the next century but sponsored the Harpstar veteran Cylyria Dragonbreast in her bid to become High Lady of Berdusk in 1321 DR, giving over leadership of his Harpers to her. Cylyria's Order of the Silver Moon and Harp was much more regimented than the eastern branch, who functioned much like they always had since the Harper King was destroyed. This also freed up Khelben for other things, like rescuing Laeral Silverhand from the Crown of Horns in 1357 DR. The Harpers of Twilight Hall, as they were colloquially known, acted openly against the Zhentarim and Amnian interests and even came close to crippling the Rundeen,[24] which brought open hostilities against Berdusk itself. The move also brought many volunteers who wanted to join the Harpers however, swelling their ranks with new members.[28] The Time of Troubles of 1358 DR caused many deaths in the Harpers but its aftermath saw the return of Finder Wyvernspur and his rise to godhood, as well as a massive disruption among the Zhentarim, which brought enough of a reprieve for the Harpers to replace their losses.[28] The Harpers were not safe from strife, however. In 1370 DR, investigators discovered evidence that implicated Khelben in the theft of an artifact, the Scepter of the Sorcerer-Kings, which had then found its way into the hands of the Zhentarim. Khelben admitted to all of the charges against him, and he and Laeral both left the Harpers,[29][30][31] as did Alustriel (who felt she could not commit to the Harpers as the leader of Luruar)[29] and many of Khelben's closest friends and allies, founding their own group: the Moonstars.[31] The government of Waterdeep refused to help the Harpers of Twilight Hall prosecute Khelben so they proceeded to ward Harper stores against Khelben and Laeral, while Khelben erected a ward that prevented any Harper from approaching Blackstaff Tower. Influenced by Bran Skorlsun, the Harpers of Twilight Hall went on a witch hunt to purge their ranks of perceived traitors while Storm's eastern branch tried to carry on with their business regardless of events in the west.[29] The Harpers were overwhelmed by the Spellplague of 1385 DR and the ensuing chaos of the Wailing Years. Many died, others vanished, and those who survived were cut off from one another, so they focused solely on the perils that menaced their homes and neighbors.[8] While the original organization was divided and its members scattered across the continent, the hope of returning the Harpers to their former glory didn't die.[32] One bastion of Harper strength remained, however: Moongleam Tower was run by Eaerlraun Shadowlyn, who tried to keep the Harper ideals alive and around 1419 DR refounded the group as the \"Harpers of Luruar\" to secretly counter the forces of Netheril.[1] Following the example of the Harpers of Luruar, other Harper cells began to operate again throughout the Realms. Some of these groups were clearly new organizations that adopted the name and some of the ideals of the Harpers of old, while others were groups of Harpers that had survived the fall of the organization during the Spellplague but had gone underground and now returned to action,[33] such as the \"Harpers of Waterdeep\" and the \"Harpers of Cormyr and the Dales\", led by Storm Silverhand, which many felt were the spiritual successors of the original Harpers.[32] Several other groups who called themselves Harpers appeared in the following years. The \"Harpers of Athkatla\" worked against the Council of Five and other Amnian authorities, but although they claimed to share the ideals of the Harpers of old, they didn't and merely claimed to to gain support. The \"Harpers of Selgaunt\" and the \"Harpers of Ormpur\" were also rebels who did not really cleave to Harper ideals.[33] These new Harpers brought with them enemies of their own, such as the Abolethic Sovereignty, Szass Tam's Thay, the Zhentarim, and the Warlock Knights of Vaasa.[32] By 1475 DR, the \"Harpers of Luruar\" had managed the cripple the efforts of the Netherese in significant ways.[8] Unfortunately, Eaerlraun was killed by shadovar assassins and the Harpers were forced to act in complete secrecy to prevent the loss of more members.[1] In 1478 DR, the Harpers of Waterdeep were led by a Harper agent known as \"the Fisher\", who was actually a double agent working for the Zhentarim to undermine Harper operations. Although Tam Zawad and other Harpers were able to bring the Fisher to justice, he had done great damage to the Harpers of Waterdeep. By 1486 DR, Zawad was still dealing with corrupt Harpers within his Harper cell.[32] The \"Harpers of Neverwinter\" also suffered a devastating blow in 1479 DR. One of their high-ranking members, Cymril, was helping the Sons of Alagondar to oppose the rule of Dagult Neverember. However, an ambush by Mintarn Mercenaries resulted in her death, and in the revelation that she was also working for Neverember.[34] After her treachery was revealed, the reputation of the Harpers of Neverwinter was greatly damaged in the region, at least for a time.[35] In the time of Mystra's Return,[36] Storm Silverhand began to revitalize the Harper organization in Cormyr. She sought out people from all walks of life: smiths, merchants, leather workers, and even those who worked in brothels. Her revitalizing actions were known and tolerated by the War Wizards of Cormyr.[37] The Harpers prevented the assassination of King's Lord Lothan Durncaskyn who was sheltering Mirt's lady, Rensharra Ironstave.[38] When the Cult of the Dragon tried to bring the goddess Tiamat to the Material Plane, circa 1487 DR, the Harpers were one of the many factions who rose up to oppose Tiamat's attempt at freedom. Since then, the Harpers became an active organization across the Realms again.[39] Harpers could be of any age or profession, any sex or gender, and of any race. Humans, elves, and half-elves were most common among them, but a few gnomes, halflings, and dwarves, and even woodland folk like dryads and centaurs also joined. Most members were either rangers or bards, though wizards, rogues, fighters and clerics were also present. Priests could follow any faith; Azuth, Deneir, Eldath, Lliira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Sel\u00fbne, Silvanus, Tymora, and the Seldarine. This caused no issues of faith, though there was some friction with upper ranks of clergy. Druids, particularly of the North, tended to their willing allies rather than members.[40] The Harpers were led by a council of High Harpers, who were responsible for most of the group's long-term plans and goals.[8][3] High Harpers were elected through the means of secret ballots among the other High Harpers, with the criteria being long-term service and extreme discretion in the implementation of their plans.[3] The Harpers operated mainly in north Faer\u00fbn, along the Sword Coast, the Western Heartlands, and the Dalelands.[41] The group itself was extremely decentralized and the nearest thing they had to a base of operations was Twilight Hall in Berdusk. An often-employed means of achieving their goals was assisting adventurers who were on quests that would further Harper interests.[3] In the 15th century DR, the Harpers became active across all of Faer\u00fbn.[32] Due to the influence of the Moonstars, the Harpers had a relatively small amount of influence within the City of Splendors around 1372 DR. They had roughly 120 members at any time within the city's walls.[4] Many gods supported the organization of the Harpers: the churches of Azuth, Deneir, Eldath, Lliira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Sel\u00fbne, Shaundakul, Shiallia, Silvanus, Tymora, and the entire Seldarine all contributed clerics to become members of the Harpers and many of these also lent divine aid to the members of the group on a regular basis.[10] This could cause tensions between individual clerics of different faiths but never between deities or between the society as a whole and deities.[40] The drow goddess Eilistraee was among the good deities who looked kindly on Those Who Harp,[42][43] while they in turn supported her church on the surface.[44] Powerful individuals supported the Harpers, but equally powerful forces opposed them. Among these were the likes of the Dark Dagger, the malaugrym, the Rundeen, the Eldreth Veluuthra, the Twisted Rune, the Knights of the Shield, the Iron Throne, the Cult of the Dragon, the Red Wizards of Thay, the Zhentarim, and many of the churches of dark gods, in particular the revived church of Bane.[45][3] \"A Harper holds peaceful sharing of the lands above all other goals.\n\"By sharing, we mean all the races living in and under the land, where each prefers to live, trading together where desire and need stir them to, and respecting each other's holds and ways\u2014without the daily bloodletting that all too often holds sway in the Realms today.",

        "description": "   A stirge with feathered wings. The bodies of stirges could be summed as resembling a monstrous cross between a large bat and an oversized mosquito,[2] or an oversized mosquito and a bird.[7] On average their bodies grew to be 1\u202ffoot (0.3\u202fmeters) in length, with a wingspan of 2\u202ffeet (0.61\u202fmeters).[4] Males and females were outwardly identical in appearance.[8] Their bodies were short and furry,[4] though some described them as being covered in feathers that ranged in shades of rusty red to reddish brown. Their eyes had a yellowish hue.[5][6][9] Their wings were membranous and bat-like,[4] interlaced with thin-walled blood vessels.[10] They had four legs that were eight-jointed[4] and ended in sharp pincers,[2][4] which were sometimes said to have a similar hue to their eyes.[5][6] Their most prominent feature was their long, sharp needle-like proboscis,[2][4][5][6] which was pink at the tip and faded to grey at the base.[4][5][6] Newborn stirges were only capable of gliding, not flying, and thus spent the first four months of their lives being carried on their mother's back.[8] Stirge mothers were capable of carrying up to two of their young on their backs.[11] Stirges had an average animal-level of intelligence.[5] The scent of blood often drew stirges to battles[3] and even into the fatal grasp of such things as vampiric mists.[12] Stirges were cannibalistic creatures and drained blood out out of their recently dead kin.[13] Perhaps the most curious behavior of stirges was singing. When the creatures were feeding, they \"hummed\" macabre tunes.[14][13] The eyes of a stirge were capable of seeing in areas of total darkness,[2][3][4][5] in areas with low-light conditions,[4] and even heat sources within 200\u202ffeet (61\u202fmeters) of them. They also had an acute sense of smell.[5] While alive, their bodies produced a clear liquid that acted as an anti-coagulant and was stored within the tip of their proboscis. They drew small quantities of the blood they ingested into lesser cavities just beneath their backbone. Within these cavities blood sugar was converted into body energy and ingested blood into plasma balanced for its own bodily use. This allowed a stirge to replace its own blood when needed, hastening its recovery.[10] Stirges feeding on an unfortunate adventurer. During battles, a stirge typically would indiscriminately attack any creature that was wounded.[3] In small numbers they were quite manageable for most adventurers, only becoming formidable threats when in large groups.[2][4] They used their pincer legs to latch on to their prey and then looked for a vulnerable spot of flesh to plunge their probosci into.[2][4] Their legs themselves were not strong enough to be effective weapons. And due to their diet, their probosci were liable to transmit some disease,[10] typically those related to blood.[8] Once attached to its prey, a stirge would feed until it was sated. Once sated, it would attempt to fly away to digest its meal. It was difficult to remove a feeding stirge, with some saying the only way was to kill it.[2][3][6] They were so persistent, that a swarm of ravenous stirges would chase their prey for miles if need be.[3] In 1357 DR, stirges were known to be occasionally encountered in the sewers of Waterdeep[15] Circa 1358 DR, Lord Hund's Tomb had skeletal stirges as part of its defenses. These undead creatures were immune to being turned as long as they remained in the tomb.[16] In 1374 DR, the Shadowscale lizardfolk placed captured stirges inside sealed clay pots, which they would then hurl as grenades at their foes. The angry stirge would then attack the nearest living being, ignoring the undead Shadowscales.[17] Singular stirges were rarely ever encountered, as these creatures tended to live and hunt in large groups. These were known as flocks,[3] colonies,[5] or \"thirsts\".[18] On average these consisted of around three to thirty specimens.[10] The territory of a colony generally extended out for only 1\u202fmile (1,600\u202fmeters) in diameter. Their presence in an area was often discovered long after they had migrated to a new territory, making it difficult to track them.[5] Much like a bat, stirges hung upside down when sleeping.[5] They bred freely year round and reproduced by live birth, in litters of one to three, with a gestation period of six months.[8] These young were known as \"stirgelings.\"[11] Most stirges were content with feeding upon large mammals such as cattle, deer, and moose, though some species preferred to dine particularly on the blood of humans.[5] A fully nourished stirge could subsist on its digested blood for a period of seventy two hours, and could go on for another twenty four-hours without food before starving to death.[11] Stirges were typically found in forests, underground,[6] in caves, in ruins,[3] or in marshes in areas with a warm climate.[4] In the Dalelands, stirges inhabited Velarswood near the center of Harrowdale,[19] Mistledale, Shadowdale, and around the Pool of Yeven.[20] In northwest Faer\u00fbn they could be found in the Ardeep Forest[21] and Gaustar's Creek.[22][23] And in south Faer\u00fbn they could be found in the Duskwood of the Lake of Steam region.[24] In the Unapproachable East, stirges inhabited the Umber Marshes of Aglarond.[25] In the Underdark, stirges frequented the Bonewatch Pass.[26] Stirges in Cormanthor lived in colonies that had a roaming area of around one square mile, and they slept by day. At night, they picked on weaker or smaller animals such as dogs, goats, or pheasants and sucked their blood. Female stirges outnumbered the males ten to one, and would fly to a distant area, usually the rimwood, to lay their eggs so that their young would not provide them with competition for food. The eggs were laid in a shallow hole in the ground and covered with dust or plants. The females then hibernated. Around ninety percent of the eggs were lost to predators such as badgers or wild pigs because they were unprotected and poorly disguised. When the remaining eggs hatched, the young would usually fly up to a hundred miles to establish their own territory.[27] The inside of broken or hatched stirge eggs contained a green foul-smelling jelly that would deter stirges from attacking for up to a whole day if it was rubbed on the skin.[27] Stirges communicated with each other by wagging their probosci,[10] to indicate that food or a dangerous enemy had been found, as well as the direction, size, and strength of said creature.[8] Stirges were capable of being bred in captivity.[5] Some people were known to have them as familiars.[28] Both goblins and kobolds were known to sometimes capture stirges and use them in traps.[3] Some stirge colonies were known to live in symbiotic relationships with evil dragons[5] or webbirds.[29] They also tended to lair near bloodthorns in hopes of preying upon their ensnared victims.[30] If properly treated their proboscis could be used as a stabbing instrument. Goblins were often known to utilize them in this way.[10] The muscle at the base of a stirge's wings could be safely eaten, although it had to be carved and cleaned very carefully and had to be prepared within a day of the creature's death. The flavor was similar to pork or sausage, and it was sometimes served baked with toast.[31] The Librarium on the first level of Undermountain contained a recipe book that described dishes that could be made with freshly killed stirges.[32] The origins of stirges were a mystery. Sages who specialized in the zoology of fantastical creatures speculated that they were created by vampiric wizards to throw hunters of the undead off their track. Others believed that they were created by a group of evil wizards, who gathered them in the millions and then sicked the beasts on enemy armies that were arrayed against them.[7]",

        "description": "   The bodies of stone giants had a gray to grayish-brown skin tone, hair that ranged in a spectrum of dark grays and bluish-grays, and eyes of a silver or steel hue. They also tended to wear clothing that was of a similar color to nearby rocks, which altogether made it easy for their race to blend in with their environment when needed.[6] Adults averaged about 18\u202ffeet (5.5\u202fmeters) in height,[5][11][13] although fossilized stone giants from the era of Ostoria show that in the past their race was capable of reaching heights of up to 24\u202ffeet (7.3\u202fmeters).[14] Though thinner and less bulky than fire giants, who were about the same height on average, a stone giant's thicker, heavier flesh made them weigh significantly more, at about 9,000\u202fpounds (4,100\u202fkilograms).[5][note 1] Stone giants had an excellent sense of smell and had infravision sight of up to 200\u202ffeet (61\u202fmeters).[15] Stone giants were the longest living of the giants and generally considered among their peers to be the wisest of all giant races, despite their low position in the ordning. And their hearts were known to beat four times slower than that of a human.[16] Stone giants preferred to fight using ranged weapons such as boulders, but if forced into melee they wielded gigantic stone clubs.[4] Some were fond of simply flinging their smaller enemies through the air.[17] The stone giant race began with an individual by the name of Obadai, one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea, who in the kingdom of Ostoria was ceded control of the Underdark.[18] Within this mighty kingdom they created some of the greatest works of giant art.[19] For example, they would regularly carve stalactites and pillars so that they resonated in the wind, thus creating a sort of song that was attuned to whoever stood before them.[20] A stone giant carving a rune. Stone giant family bonds were less important than the bonds between a master and his pupil.[15] The ordering of stone giant society was based upon an individual's artistic ability.[24] The strongest stone giant nation was Cairnheim in the Underdark.[25] It was a village[26] located in the western part of the Darklands[27] in the Upperdark inside the Giant's Run Mountains under the rule of the stone giant lich Dodkong.[26] Stone giants that spent too much time on the surface, either during their dream quests or as a result of banishment from their communities, became dreamwalkers, driven so far into madness by their isolation to the point that reality itself bent around them.[2] Due to the resilience of their skin, stone giants were known to be immune to all forms of lycanthropy.[28] These giants were typically found living in temperate mountain ranges,[4] caves, or caverns.[6] Stone giants were powerful enough to survive and make a living in the Underdark in the face of competition.[25] They had a tendency to gather in larger individual groups the deeper the given group was located,[29] but were primarily denizens of the Upperdark, though their numbers were small even there.[25] They carved their homes out of the rock and had a reputation as good artisans, though they generally maintained an uncaring stance towards other denizens of the Underdark and expected the same stance from the others.[25] Stone giants were known to speak the general giant language Jotun. But they also possessed their own language known as Jotunstein, which was derived from both Jotun and Auld Dwarvish.[7] The written form of this language was known as \"Metamorpherie\".[30] Common given names among stone giants included the following:[31] Like all true giants, stone giants worshiped Annam All-Father as their chief deity, but unlike the other races they envisioned him as being an artist whose skills were perfection.[32] Their patron deity among Annam's children was Skoraeus Stonebones, though lesser deities Hiatea and Iallanis were also known to have a significant following among the stone giants.[33] Priests of Skoraeus felt that their duty was to oversee their society's affairs and ensure that the stone giants as a whole continued to progress towards greater achievements in art and intellectual thought. But in order to accomplish this goal, they believed that their race needed to isolate itself from others, with the exception of individuals who might help expand upon their mastery of craftsmanship.[34] Animal domestication was not common among them, though many were known to raise colonies of giant bats as a warning system and source of food.[35] While others have been seen in the company of giant goats[36] and cave bears.[6] Out of all animals they considered purple worms to be the greatest of pests, since they could effortlessly burrow through their homes and destroy prized carvings.[35] Stone giants' finger bones were used by crafters from the Old Empires to create more powerful versions of rings of strength.[37] True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

        "description": "   These constructs were generally made with a bipedal, humanoid shape,[6] but stylized to suit their creator.[4] Appearing as merely beautiful statues until commanded by their master to move and act.[1] They were almost never outfitted with any sort of weaponry or armor.[4] The average stone golem was about 9\u202fft (2.7\u202fm) tall and weighed approximately 2,000\u202flb (910,000\u202fg).[4][3] Stone golems were emotionless constructs who could not be reasoned with,[4] always dutifully obedient to whoever constructed them, and could be given simple commands. They could even be commanded to fall into a dormant state, then come to life and attack other creatures when hostile actions are detected.[6] Like any golem, these constructs possessed an immunity to magic and could not be harmed by normal weaponry. Only weapons with an enchantment of +2 or greater were capable of harming them, though this could be bypassed by use of the spell flesh to stone.[4][7] Being constructs made entirely of stone, these golems could be slowed down by the spell transmute rock to mud and repaired by use of its counterpart transmute mud to rock.[4][7] The strength of these golems was twice that of any flesh golem. Due to the spell being used in their construction, a stone golem was capable of casting slow at any creature within 1\u202ffoot (0.3\u202fmeters) of it.[4][6] Stone golems always fought with their brute strength and fists. They would never wield weapons, even if ordered to.[4] A rare variety of stone golems that could be found in the Hordelands. These golems were created by wu jen and given a mind of their own. They were adept at implementing martial arts maneuvers like throws during combat.[8] Like any construct, stone golems could be found anywhere across the Realms regardless of climate or terrain.[4] In older ages the cost of materials needed to construct a stone golem was around 60,000 gp, and the process took about two months. Skilled laborers, such as stone masons and dwarves, were often hired to carve the golem from its single block of hard stone.[4] Construction of these constructs could only be undertaken by magic-users of a 16th level or higher and required use of the spells geas, polymorph any object, slow and wish.[4][6] These spells could be cast by the user themselves or by means of an enchanted item, such as a scroll or wand.[4] Alternatively, the construction of a stone golem could be undertaken by any individual that owned a manual of golems[9] or the Tome of the Unicorn.[10] Stone golems were typically used to guard locations or valuable items.[4] They were often used as divine agents of the gods Clangeddin Silverbeard, Geb, Segojan Earthcaller, and the Red Knight. Those that served the latter goddess had the form of chess pieces.[11]",

        "description": "   Storm giants were the tallest of the true giants to remain on the Material Plane, standing a full 26\u202ffeet (7.9\u202fmeters) in height[1][5][10] and massing out at around 15,000\u202fpounds (6,800\u202fkilograms).[5][note 1] There were two ethnicities of storm giants; most had pale, light green skin and dark green hair and eyes, but a small number had violet skin, dark blue hair, and silver eyes.[5] They tended to wear fine tunics and belted sandals.[5] When it came to armor, they often favored the use of scale mail.[1] Storm giants had vision that was well adapted to underwater conditions, where they saw equally as well as they did in the air.[12] Likewise, their lungs were adapted to surviving in underwater conditions.[1] Storm giants were known to innately have a high affinity for runecasting as well as traditional sorcery that surpassed the capabilities of other giant races.[13] They were generally known to be capable of casting the spells call lightning, control winds, levitate \u2014 though unlike the standard spell, they were capable of lifting weights equivalent to their own \u2014 predict weather, weather summoning,[6] detect magic, feather fall, light, and water breathing.[1] Their bodies were impervious to harm from lightning and thunder, even that discharged by a blue dragon. They were even capable of generating and throwing bolts of lightning themselves,[6] at distances of up to 500\u202ffeet (150\u202fmeters).[1] Because of this they were often responsible for sightings of lightning bolts streaking across mountain peaks.[14] Some storm giants held the ability to mark and claim a mortal humanoid as a sea spawn, either by cursing them or making a pact with them.[15] Because of their high affinity for spellcasting,[13] storm giants were the least likely of giants to throw boulders at their opponents when engaging in ranged combat.[6] Whenever one did resort to throwing boulders, a storm giant's tremendous strength allowed them to be hurled as far as 60 to 240\u202ffeet (18 to 73\u202fmeters). When it came to close quarters combat, they typically favored greatswords as their weapon of choice.[1] The storm giant race began with an individual by the name of Vilmos, one of the mortal children of Annam All-Father and Othea, who in the kingdom of Ostoria was ceded control of the lakes and seas.[17] They and the titans created some of the greatest cities within this kingdom, featuring mechanical conveyances and galleries that would house artistic tributes to all giantkind.[18] The head of a storm giant tribe's ordning was called a \"paramount\".[19] In storm giant society, any act of mercy or charity towards a sentient being was seen as good.[20] Storm giants generally lived inside of castles, either located atop mountains, in the clouds, or underneath the ocean[6][4] in castles made of coral.[21] Those that could not sustain themselves on hunting alone often built large gardens, fields, or vineyards near their homes.[4] Storm giants spoke the general giant language Jotun, their own specialized version of it known as Jotunuvar, as well as Common.[22] They were often illiterate, though to a lesser degree than giant races whose cultures put little value on education, such as hill and fire giants.[23] Common given names among storm giants included the following:[24] Storm giants that dwelled on land were usually seen as being on good terms with nearby copper dragons and good-aligned cloud giants, often working with them to ensure a mutual defense.[4] They were often known to keep pets and guard animals. Those that lived in high elevations, meaning clouds or mountains, typically kept animals such as rocs and griffons. Those that lived underwater would often keep sea lions.[6] True Giant Offshoots\nAsh \u2022 Craa'ghoran \u2022 Maur \u2022 Phaerlin\nGiant-Kin\nCyclops (Cyclopskin) \u2022 Firbolg \u2022 Fomorian \u2022 Ogre (Oni) \u2022 Verbeeg \u2022 Voadkyn\nZakharan Giants\nDesert \u2022 Island \u2022 Jungle \u2022 Ogre giant \u2022 Reef",

        "description": "   The male counterpart of this creature was called an incubus (pronounced: /\u02c8\u026a\u014bkju\u02d0b\u028cs/ INK-yoo-bus[9]).[5][6] Legend held that incubi and succubi were wholly separate sexes,[1] and the males were significantly rarer than the female of their kind.[5][6] In fact, with their shapechanging powers, incubi and succubi could both change their sex with ease, though most had a preference for one or the other.[2][1][note 2] When uncovered in her true form, a succubus appeared as a stunningly beautiful woman of statuesque build and perfect figure, with flawless skin and red or raven-black hair, but also clawed fingers and large dark-hued or reddish bat-like wings mounted on their backs. Their eyes were said to smolder with sinister desire.[1][2][3][5][6][7][note 3] Small horns or a tail might also be seen.[1][3][7][note 4] Succubi stood on average around 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall and weighed 125 pounds (57 kilograms).[3][5][6][7] Demonic succubi were by far the most attractive of the otherwise-hideous tanar'ri, maybe even of all demons.[3] An incubus, for the ladies. Or the men. Incubi, meanwhile, appeared as perfect male members of whatever race they were working with.[5][6] However, succubi often used their shapechanging ability to assume a humanoid form, and could maintain it as a disguise for as long as they liked.[3][5][6] Thus mortals rarely saw succubi and incubi in their true forms[1] but they were always attractive to an observer.[2] With a kiss of her lips, an embrace in her arms, or something more intimate, a succubus could drain the life energy of a mortal who lacked stamina, weakening them in every aspect[3][5][6][7] or wounding their psyche until they died or escaped and took time to recover.[1] For mortals who were unwilling\u2014and the certain few who were willing\u2014the succubus would have to charm or grapple them to lay her kiss somewhere. Caught in the throes of passion, victims often didn't notice their life being drained away, unless they could keep their heads.[3][5][6][7] However, a kiss from a fiendish succubus was actually quite painful, giving no satisfaction, only utter emptiness.[1] One slain by this life-draining kiss might rise again as a greater vampire; for example, this was the way Jonathon Morningmist was turned.[10] Moreover, as with a suggestion spell, the kiss of a demonic succubus could make the victim desire another kiss if they did not have the willpower to resist, and yet another, so they inevitably and willingly gave up their energy to the succubus.[3] Originally, demonic succubi were presumed to be capable of any kind of suggestion, without need of a kiss.[5][6] In contrast, a devilish succubus was commanding and dominant. Her kiss had instead a charming effect, causing a victim to be unable to attack her and even take attacks meant for their new mistress. If the succubus could keep her slave, then a kiss once a day was enough to keep them in her thrall, though she could only have one such slave at a time. Furthermore, at will, she could dominate the mind of another, even at a distance, though only for several seconds. They usually used this to make a worthy target come to them for the charming kiss.[2] To aid their seduction, a succubus or incubus could change their body, as with a polymorph or shapechange spell, into any humanoid form, as small as a halfling or tall as a human of roughly their own height and weight. Not fussy, this could even include demihumans. They could maintain this appearance indefinitely, and it granted them skill in disguise. They could even take the forms of specific people.[3][5][6][7][2][1] However, for a fiendish succubus, this disguise did not extend to whatever they carried or wore, if anything. When slain, they reverted to their fiendish forms.[1] Succubi were uncanny linguists, able to speak all languages, or at least just the language of their victim, as with a permanent tongues spell. Like other demons, they possessed telepathy, but they preferred to speak aloud with mortals.[3][5][6] With those they'd charmed, a fiendish succubus could forge a telepathic bond that stretched even to other planes.[1] Demonic succubi had an array of other powers too, being able to become ethereal (as with an oil of etherealness[5][6][7] or ethereal jaunt, though only themselves and what they carried[3]), to charm people[5][6][7] and even monsters,[3] to read minds,[5][6][3][7] to listen from afar as with clairaudience,[5][6][7] and to cross planes as with plane shift[5][6] or greater teleport (but taking only themselves and what they carried).[3] They could use such magic as often as they pleased.[3][5][6][7] Moreover, once a day, demonic succubi could attempt to summon back-up if threatened. Originally, with a 40% chance of success, they could gate in a type IV or type VI demon or, very rarely, even a demon prince or lord.[7] After the Time of Troubles of 1358 DR, this came in the form of a single balor with a 40% chance of success.[5][6] After the Year of Wild Magic, 1372 DR, this was but a single vrock with only a 30% success rate.[3] While devilish succubi lacked all this magic, they also had a corrupting touch with which to defend themselves.[2] Fiendish succubi could become ethereal by slipping into the Ethereal Plane. They could also magically charm a humanoid, in sight up to 30 feet (9.1 meters) away, and make them obey any command they gave them. The victim might resist, especially if made to perform a harmful or suicidal action. Resisting freed their mind for 24 hours, but failure kept them beholden to the succubus for a full day. The succubus could only have one charmed victim at a time; taking another would free the last one.[1] They were good listeners and very observant. They were persuasive, deceptive, stealthy, and had a little skill in bonds, both tying them and escaping them, and not just recreationally.[3] As demons, they were immune to all fire, whether mundane or magical, and could only be hurt by moderately enchanted weapons.[5][6][7] Later, they were considered to be immune to electricity and poison; resistant to acid, cold, and fire and to spells; and were best harmed by cold iron or good weapons.[3] Devilish succubi were merely highly resistant to fire.[2] Fiendish succubi were resistant to cold, fire, lightning, poison, and mundane attacks.[1] Their wings, when they had them, let them fly with average ability.[3][2][1] Lovers, not fighters, succubi fled all conflict if they could, using their claws only as a last resort, but these were only usable if revealed in their fiendish form.[3][5][6][1] Rather, they focused on dodging blows and running for safety.[3] Nevertheless, they were rarely taken by surprise.[5][6] Instead, they preferred subterfuge and seduction, turning their enemies against each other, making them into loyal servants, or trying to get individuals alone.[3][2] A preferred tactic was to disguise themselves and feign friendship or pretend to be a damsel in distress, especially if encountered in a dungeon, then find a moment to be alone with a potential victim where they could use their life-draining kiss.[3] Succubi and incubi were lusty creatures.[1] A fiendish succubus desired a corrupted soul like nothing else, feeling utter emptiness until they claimed one. Their deadly kiss was an echo of this emptiness.[1] A succubus watches the sun set. Demonic succubi lived to seduce and tempt mortal beings of the Prime Material Plane,[3][5][6] and in the end slay them and carry their life-forces back with them, for the destruction of mortals increased the power of the Abyss. This in turn aided the demons in the Blood War.[5][6] They seemed to have fed on this life-force themselves.[11] Many succubi and incubi were engaged almost constantly working to corrupt mortals, usually via promises of sex and other pleasures.[12] Demonic succubi typically targeted men of energy and passion. The fiery spirits of humans meant they were easier prey, so succubi did not often concern themselves with demihumans. They were content to take things slow and work subtly. Incubi meanwhile tempted mortal females.[5][6] Devilish succubi were adept at winning hearts and breaking hearts, but they also made for cunning and skilled spies and assassins. They served higher-ranked devils as scouts and advisors, as emissaries to key mortals, and of course as concubines.[2] They tempted mortals into sin on behalf of Asmodeus.[1] Fiendish succubi commonly used their ethereal form to slip through walls to reach a mortal's bedside, and linger there as they slept. Here, they filled their victim's dreams with debauched scenes and whispered of forbidden pleasures, tempting them to indulge in dark desires, appetites, and taboos. The more the succubus did this in their dreams, the more vulnerable their victim became to temptation in the waking world. Eventually, the succubus entered the mortal realm directly, in a pleasing form previously seen only in the dreams, and befriended or seduced their victim, so they could influence them directly and indulge all their desires so they would perform evil deeds of their own free will. When the victim was utterly corrupted, such as by committing three betrayals of thought, word, and deed, their soul was in the grip of the succubus, without need of contract or pledge. For a more virtuous victim, this corruption might take longer, but their downfall was all the more rewarding for the succubus. Finally, the succubus slew their victim with a kiss, and the corrupted soul went down to the Lower Planes as their prize. The succubus actually avoided charming the victim if they could help it, as the mortal would not be responsible for their actions and not truly corrupted. Thus, charming was mostly used for self-defense. Similarly, their lethal kiss was only used as a final assault or a parting shot before they escaped.[1] Three demons: a nalfeshnee, a quasit, and a succubus. The succubus is the better-looking one. Demonic succubi were independent of tanar'ri society, going where they liked, doing as they willed, and answering to none. The greater tanar'ri tolerated them and even accepted their independence, for they served the Abyss in their own unique way.[5][6] In turn, succubi could dominate lesser demons through a mixture of threats and wits.[7] They occasionally worked with babaus[13] but chasmes nursed a traditional hatred of succubi and would kill them given the chance.[14] Succubi and incubi were known to serve demon lords like Graz'zt as advisors and consorts. Graz'zt never went anywhere without a retinue of six succubi, mariliths, or lamias[1][15] and his servant Yattara commanded a small squad of fellow succubi who engaged in espionage and infiltration.[16] However, it was the demon lord Malcanthet who was renowned as the \"Queen of the Succubi\"; lesser demon lords like Shami-Amourae and Lynkhab contested for her title without success. Malcanthet was served by countless incubi and succubi in her palace, and she birthed many deadly succubi daughters to Pazuzu.[17] Succubi also served the demon lord Eltab in the Citadel of Conjurers,[18] and in the army of the balor Ndulu.[19] Some succubi, like Soneillon, the Queen of Whispers, were free agents working their own grand plots.[20] Fiendish succubi served greater fiends of all kinds, from demons to devils, and night hags and rakshasas and yugoloths in between.[1] Preferring to work alone, demonic succubi operated as singles[3][5][6][7] and rarely gathered in numbers.[7] Succubi greatly outnumbered incubi. The reason for this was unknown, but sages speculated it was because mortal men were more easily swayed by beauty than women.[5][6] Once it was considered that demonic succubi and incubi did not mate with one another to procreate.[5][6] However, fiendish succubi and incubi could indeed reproduce to birth more of their race.[1] The female child of a succubus and a human male was traditionally called an alu-fiend. Those with non-evil human fathers had a slight tendency to avoid the evil of their heritage.[21] The male child of an incubus (indeed, any lesser tanar'ri) and a human female was a cambion. Again, those with non-evil human fathers had a slight tendency to be non-evil.[22] In the Realms circa 1370 DR, these terms were defined regardless of sex: a cambion was the spawn of a tanar'ri and a human or demihuman, while alu-fiends were specifically a subgroup of cambions with succubus or incubus parents. Finally, tanar'ric tieflings were any descendants with a less than 50% demonic bloodline[23] or even more distant ancestry. Succubi, along with mariliths, were the most common ancestors of these demon-blooded tieflings.[24] Circa 1487 DR, a cambion was considered the child of a humanoid and a fiendish succubus or incubus, and to be as villainous as the fiendish parent.[1] Circa \u22124800 DR, the half-fiend sun elf House Dlardrageth allied with three minor noble houses\u2014Aelorothi, Ealoeth, and Floshin\u2014of the sun elven realm of Siluvanede and incited crossbreeding with demons to strengthen their bloodlines. Naturally, succubi and incubi lay among these demons. These unions spawned demon\u2013elf hybrids: half-elf cambions and alu-fiends known as daemonfey and the half-elf tieflings known as fey'ri. The fey'ri had the power to shapeshift as easily as their succubi and incubi ancestors did. These now fey'ri houses, while hiding their heritage, soon began to dominate Siluvanede.[25][23][26][27][28][29][30][note 5] Soneillon, the Queen of Whispers, giving sleeping to the top a bad name. In the Year of the Dowager Lady, 726 DR, an army of demons called the Scaled Horde emerged from the western Rawlinswood and Forest of Lethyr and conquered the kingdom of Impiltur.[31] Commanded by the balor Ndulu, they comprised mostly succubi and glabrezu.[19] Among them was the succubus known as Soneillon, who engineered the fall of the Durlaven dynasty then reigned as consort of King Agrosh the Scaled, styling herself the Queen of Whispers. She escaped when Agrosh was slain three years later.[20] In the Year of Visions, 731 DR, the paladin Sarshel Elethlim defeated Ndulu in the Citadel of Conjurers, ending the Fiend Wars, but the balor and his demon army escaped and dispersed.[19][31] Over the next half-century, Ndulu regathered his succubi and glabrezu, with Soneillon serving him as his chief spy and favorite consort. Finally, in the Year of the Moaning Gorge, 786 DR, Soneillon disguised herself as Prince Nord's mistress, but he narrowly resisted being subverted to her will, and she was imprisoned. Afterward, Ndulu's demons clashed with the grandsons of King Sarshel, the Paladin Princes, who created a vortex portal that sucked all the demon horde back to the Abyss. In following years, the remaining fiends were hunted by King Nord.[19][20][32] Soneillon escaped imprisonment and spent centuries sowing corruption and strife in Impiltur and Chondath.[20] After the destruction of Hellgate Keep in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, its surviving tanar'ri denizens dispersed across the North. At least seven succubi hid within the cities of Everlund, Sundabar, and Yartar by 1370 DR.[33] In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, the demon lord Eltab escaped into the Citadel of Conjurers, and released the glabrezu and succubi he found bound in its upper catacombs. They went on to serve him.[18] Whereas succubi and incubi were previously known to be tanar'ri demons of the Abyss,[3][5][6][7] by 1479 DR they were presumed to be devils of the Nine Hells.[2] According to Lorcan, this was because the succubi decided on a species-wide level to switch allegiances around the same time as Asmodeus gained his godhood after the Spellplague of 1385 DR. Rumor was that, through this act, Asmodeus gained the last bit of necessary power to push the Abyss to the bottom of the Elemental Chaos to end the Blood War.[34] After the Second Sundering of 1487 DR, the succubi had transitioned and become fiends found across the Lower Planes, and on the whole bound to none except how they preferred it.[1] \"Succubus\" could be used as a nickname or title in the Realms. \"The Succubus\" was an assassin of the Night Masks active around 1370 DR known for using contact poison on her lips and killing with a kiss.[35] The goddess Sharess was called \"Succubus of Sensation\".[36] Other Fiends\nAchaierai \u2022 Barghest \u2022 Canomorph (Haraknin \u2022 Shadurakul) \u2022 Hell hound \u2022 Hordling \u2022 Howler \u2022 Larva \u2022 Maelephant \u2022 Marrashi \u2022 Night hag \u2022 Nightmare \u2022 Rakshasa \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Vargouille \u2022 Yeth hound Least: Lemure \u2022 Nupperibo \u2022 Spinagon\nLesser: Abishai (Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 Red \u2022 White) \u2022 Barbazu \u2022 Erinyes \u2022 Excruciarch \u2022 Ghargatula \u2022 Hamatula (Stony devil) \u2022 Kocrachon \u2022 Merregon \u2022 Osyluth \u2022 War devil \u2022 Xerfilstyx\nGreater: Amnizu \u2022 Cornugon \u2022 Gelugon \u2022 Logokron \u2022 Narzugon \u2022 Orthon \u2022 Paeliryon \u2022 Pit fiend\nBaatezu of unknown rank: Advespa \u2022 Dogai \u2022 Gulthir \u2022 Jerul Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

        "description": "   Staves of swarming insects usually were crafted to be thick, short, and stout. The entirety of these staves' shafts were carved with images of flying, biting, and stinging incests. Some of the carvings depicted wasps, bees, deerflies, horseflies, and other unpleasant vermin.[7] When wielded by an individual who could access divine magics, these weapons allowed them to summon swarms of insects, similar to those carved on the shaft. Staves of swarming insects had limited number of charges and each summon expended a single charge. Each charge was represented by the carvings on the staff. When a charge was expended, a single insect carving vanished from the weapon. A staff of swarming insects could hold as many as fifty charges, but it could not be recharged, becoming a mundane staff when its magics were depleted.[7] An average distance for the swarm summon was 60\u202ffeet (18\u202fmeters) and it increased the more proficient and powerful the divine magic wielder was. The same was true abut the number of insects spawned in a swarm. The initial number was sixty, and it increased with the power of the wielder.[7] Insects summoned by the staves of swarming insects could be repelled by the protection from evil spell or by fire.[7] Following the Second Sundering, a new version of staves of swarming insects appeared. It was usable not only by divine magic users, but also by bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. The number of charges of these universal staves did not go beyond ten but they regenerated between five and ten charges per day. When the last charge was used up, there was a chance of the summoned insects devouring the weapon, destroying it completely. Unlike their divine magic counterparts, these staves allowed the owner to cast giant insect and insect plague spells. Another ability of these staves was creation of a swarm of harmless flying insects that disappeared ten minutes after being conjured.[10] In the late-14th century DR, a colony of ixitxachitl of the Fang Rocks were believed to hoard magical treasures from Sembia. The exact nature of it was unknown, but some claimed that a staff of swarming insects was among them.[2]",

        "description": "   Staves of swarming insects usually were crafted to be thick, short, and stout. The entirety of these staves' shafts were carved with images of flying, biting, and stinging incests. Some of the carvings depicted wasps, bees, deerflies, horseflies, and other unpleasant vermin.[7] When wielded by an individual who could access divine magics, these weapons allowed them to summon swarms of insects, similar to those carved on the shaft. Staves of swarming insects had limited number of charges and each summon expended a single charge. Each charge was represented by the carvings on the staff. When a charge was expended, a single insect carving vanished from the weapon. A staff of swarming insects could hold as many as fifty charges, but it could not be recharged, becoming a mundane staff when its magics were depleted.[7] An average distance for the swarm summon was 60\u202ffeet (18\u202fmeters) and it increased the more proficient and powerful the divine magic wielder was. The same was true abut the number of insects spawned in a swarm. The initial number was sixty, and it increased with the power of the wielder.[7] Insects summoned by the staves of swarming insects could be repelled by the protection from evil spell or by fire.[7] Following the Second Sundering, a new version of staves of swarming insects appeared. It was usable not only by divine magic users, but also by bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards. The number of charges of these universal staves did not go beyond ten but they regenerated between five and ten charges per day. When the last charge was used up, there was a chance of the summoned insects devouring the weapon, destroying it completely. Unlike their divine magic counterparts, these staves allowed the owner to cast giant insect and insect plague spells. Another ability of these staves was creation of a swarm of harmless flying insects that disappeared ten minutes after being conjured.[10] In the late-14th century DR, a colony of ixitxachitl of the Fang Rocks were believed to hoard magical treasures from Sembia. The exact nature of it was unknown, but some claimed that a staff of swarming insects was among them.[2]",

        "description": " This is a\nGood Article!   The Raven Queen did not possess or manifest a physical form, instead appearing as a miscellany of symbols, perceptions, and images.[1] The Raven Queen was obsessed with collecting and observing mementos and fragments of memories and essences.[1] Many sages speculated that she was in fact insane, believing her methods and behavior little more than aimless curiosity or a desperate attempt to prevent her fragile existence from fading into oblivion. Others maintained that there was a cosmological function that was performed by the Queen's actions, as she purified souls by forcing mortals to deal with their fears and pains. It was believed that her true intentions were only known to the Lady of Pain.[8] One of the Raven Queen's divine realms in the Shadowfell was a castle known as the Fortress of Memories. It was a place of overwhelming sorrow, overflowing with memories taken from mortals and fragments of dead deities, material objects collected by the shadar-kai and brought to her as gifts, and apparitions of creatures and places associated with strongly emotional stories. Swarms of ravens occasionally flew out of the fortress, taking her cryptic messages to the far reaches of the multiverse and acting as the Queen's eyes and ears while away.[1] The Fortress of Memories, realm of the Raven Queen in the Shadowfell. The Raven Queen was also said to claim a domain in the Shadowfell known as Letherna, a fortress of black ice within a frozen forest through which the souls of the deceased had to pass before reaching the afterlife, according to some versions of the World Axis cosmology.[9] The whole existence of the Raven Queen was focused on collecting memories and strong emotions, typically associated with loss and tragedy. To that end, she dispatched shadar-kai to the far confines of the multiverse to wait for such an event to unfold, as scouted by her ravens. Then they collected mementos, such as trinkets, memories from the living and sometimes the souls of the dead, and brought them back to her.[8] The Raven Queen also claimed domain of the souls of all shadar-kai, which always returned to her after their deaths.[8] She was said to have forged the first weapons infused with shadow magic. These sentient blades, such as the Blackrazor, were found in many locations throughout the multiverse and were capable of binding with their wielders. For that reason, the Raven Queen was a popular hexblade patron among warlocks.[10] One of the Raven Queen's greatest enemies was the demon lord Orcus, who constantly sought control of the Shadowfell. He hoped to find a weakness in her domain by discovering her true name.[11] Another devout enemy of the Raven Queen was the Oerthian lesser deity Vecna, who envied her for her unique abilities to tap into the flow of souls and to harvest knowledge. One of his goals was to overthrow the Queen and rule the entire Shadowfell from her Fortress of Memories. Vecna's servants constantly battled with the Raven Queen's shadar-kai followers.[8] Other wizards and necromancers craved the Raven Queen's knowledge and domain over souls. Attempts at conquering the Fortress of Memories were constant, but were always thwarted by her more fanatical shadar-kai defenders.[8] The Prince of Frost hated the Raven Queen for her role in the loss of his beloved, Sharaea. The powerful fey woman had fallen in love with a mortal hero, causing him to grow jealous, and she feared for the safety of her mortal lover if she tried to deny him. She struck a bargain with the Raven Queen to cast her soul into the future, hoping that time would allow the former Sun Prince to heal, only for him to grow bitter and sorrowful, eventually turning into the Prince of Frost. The Prince delighted in usurping some of the Raven Queen's power through his association with freezing death and darkness. On her part, however, the Raven Queen desired him as an exarch or even a consort.[12] The symbol of the Raven Queen. Although a complete account of the Raven Queen's motivations and origins was not generally known, it was believed that she was originally a much beloved elf queen from the Feywild who witnessed the conflict between Corellon and Lolth. Worried that the dispute might tear the Seldarine asunder, she rallied her followers to perform a powerful ritual in order to become a deity, so she could have the leverage to appeal to the deities' senses.[1] The ritual involved the offering of the queen's followers' souls and magic to add to her own power, enabling her to reach Arvandor. The followers, who called themselves shadar-kai, firmly believed that their queen was capable of reunifying the elven pantheon and the sundered elves.[1] However, evil wizards among the queen's followers attempted to divert some of the energy from the ritual to amplify their own powers. Moments before completing the ritual and reaching Arvandor, the queen reacted by punishing the wizards with a burst of divine fury. This curse corrupted the ritual into a siphon that dragged the queen and her followers into the Shadowfell, where she was instantly killed. However, thanks to her recently acquired divine powers, the queen rose from the ashes and, in her growing madness and grief, transformed the wizards into wretched avian forms known as nagpas, and banished them forever to wander the planes.[1] The queen herself was still further transformed by the corrupted ritual, her form dissolving into disconnected sensory perceptions.[1] Moreover, both Corellon and Lolth considered her actions to be treason, so they erased the memory of her existence from all elves.[8] In order to avoid disappearing entirely, she drew memories of her existence from the Shadowfell itself in order to sustain her identity. Over time, the subjective remains of the queen and the loose darkened memories gave rise to the entity that became known as the Raven Queen.[1] Another account of the Raven Queen's origin stated that she was originally a sorceress who led a rebellion against a former god of death in Pluton. In order to prevent her from becoming a tyrant in the same fashion as the defeated god, other deities elevated her to the status of goddess of death, but with no power over the dead themselves.[13]",

Spiders inhabited the forest known as the Neth Stand.[20] Adhe Wood in the Vast was infested with ettercaps and mutant spiders of many sizes and breeds.[21] Spiders were common in the Underdark, particularly in drow settlements, where they were revered by worshipers of Lolth.[22] Drow often made objects and buildings in the shape of spiders.[23][24] In cultures that venerated Lolth, it was forbidden to kill a spider; those who did so were punished with death.[25] Spiders were often kept by the drow, their purpose depending on a given spider's size. The smallest ones were kept as pets by children. Those that were big enough to kill mice, meaning hand-sized, were kept as familiars by wizards. Those that were as big as a horse were used to ride upon. Those that were the size of dogs were used like guard dogs in temples to Lolth. The last category were sometimes imbued with a demon to make older ones regain their vitality, combining it with a nasty personality.[26] Spriggans in the Feywild were sometimes known to use spiders to create web barriers in their forests.[27]",

It can use its Swallow instead of its bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tarrasque can't bite another target. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing damage. Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. Each creature of the tarrasque's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.\nIf the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone. ",
        "special_abilities_desc": "If the tarrasque fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. The tarrasque has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the target. The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures. ",
        "description": "   The tarrasque was irreversibly tied to the Prime by its nature. As a result, the most one could hope to do was put the creature to sleep within the core, holding it off for a while longer. However, ancient texts seemed to indicate that there might be a way to finally and ultimately deal with the creature, if one could somehow deceive it, luring it into another plane and sealing it there.[9] The tarrasque was an enormous abomination, roughly the size of an ancient dragon, with two long horns extending from its forehead, a thick carapace, mighty tail, many spikes covering its large body, and a wide, toothy maw. The tarrasque also had two small eyes, but it did not rely on these for its primary method of sensory perception\u2014if they were blinded or removed, it was effectively unhindered. The tarrasque was impossible to frighten or charm and had resistances to every kind of damage imaginable. It moved at a speed roughly half again that of a human, either while walking on the surface, climbing a height, or burrowing through the earth.[9] Although the tarrasque was indisputably a force of pure destruction, it was not truly evil or even chaotic by nature, lacking the consciousness necessary for it to take a moral stance. As a result, it was merely neutral in alignment.[9] The tarrasque had many unusual abilities gifted to it by its creators. Among the most terrifying of these was its ability to ignore any natural resistances its victims had, cutting right through them with its deadly attacks. It also had the ability to dramatically hinder the ability of creatures within 200\u202ffeet (61\u202fmeters) of it to fly, reducing their speed substantially while also bringing them down to a maximum altitude of twenty feet, which put them within the beast's reach.[9] The tarrasque had the ability to instill nearby creatures with terrible fear, rendering them incapable of action. It was also immune to the ill effects of fire, poison, or disease.[8] It was generally immensely difficult to injure.[9] Some scholars even claimed that they were immune to all manner of psionic attacks.[10] The history of the tarrasque was controversial. Most persons were wholly unaware of the tarrasque's existence and those that did know of it were unsure about its origins, which they surmised to be anything from its actual creation to it being the weapon of an ancient and evil cabal of wizards. Most dismissed these theories, however, as unproven musings. More important was that the tarrasque rarely left evidence or witnesses, so dangerous was its nature.[8] Some sages argued that the tarrasque was created by the primordials as a weapon of destruction during the Dawn War, with the purpose of undoing the stability instilled in the world by the gods so that the primordials could remake it. Fortunately, the primordials created only one tarrasque.[9] Another theory was that the tarrasque was but one specimen of an entire population of the creatures living on the planet Falx, which was located somewhere in another crystal sphere. Falx had several hundred creatures that were either the same species as the tarrasque of Toril or else an (unfortunate) example of convergent evolution. According to this view, Toril's tarrasque had simply been transported or summoned to Toril from Falx in ancient past.[11] A group of heroes battling a dreaded tarrasque. A unique tarrasque known as the Sleeper dwelled in the continent of Katashaka in ancient times. She was worshiped, and fed sacrifices, by the ancient Tabaxi tribe of humans and reigned over their lands. In Tabaxi legend, one season, the Sleeper desired vengeance against an ancient enemy and summoned the greatest warriors of the nine tribes to follow her into battle in Mhairshaulk (c. \u221234,800 DR to c. \u221224,000 DR). Apparently defeated, the Sleeper returned in a rage and went on a rampage on the Night of Feasting, before finally returning to sleep. She would awaken twenty-three more times, ever more angry and hungry. Finally, on the next Night of Feasting at the end of a millennium, \u22122809 DR, the next sacrifice, Oyai, was blessed by Ubtao and empowered with magic, right before the Sleeper awoke and came to devour her. But she used the magic to halt, crush, and slay the Sleeper.[12][note 1] In the final years of the first empire of Netheril, a tarrasque's lair (in what used to be southwest Anauroch) was under heavy guard by Angardt barbarians whose shaman's prophecies told of the beast's imminent awakening. In \u2212339 DR, adventurers hired by the archwizard Karsus came to cut out the tarrasque's pituitary gland, which was to be used as a spell component for the casting of Karsus's avatar. A gold dragon named Dracolnobalen, who protected the Angardt tribe, provided the adventurers working for Karsus with a liquid that she claimed would keep the tarrasque from waking again once applied to its body.[13] It seemed to have worked, since no gigantic, hungry monsters emerged from the \"lair of the sleeping beast\" since those adventurers ventured inside. Before the desert was restored to fertile land, the tarrasque's lair still existed and was known to those few who knew of its location as \"The Secret Place in the Sands\".[citation needed] However, in the Year of the Prince, 1357 DR, a mage summoned a tarrasque through a ritual that required the heads of seven adult dragons to complete. It was defeated by the crew of the Realms Master.[14][15] The tarrasque was an eating machine while awake, capable of swallowing creatures of roughly giant size whole. When roused, it would, by its design, eat quite literally the entire world, including plants and animals.[9] Fortunately, it would only be active for a week or two before it returned to its slumber to sleep for five to twenty months, although, once every decade or so, the tarrasque would stay active for several months, after which it would sleep four to sixteen years, unless disturbed.[8] Why it returned to slumber is unknown, though it seemed inevitable that at some point it would try and fulfill its purpose to destroy the world entirely.[citation needed] Legend had it that one could yield a vast number of gems from a tarrasque's upper carapace by treating it with acid and then heating it in a furnace. Other legends spoke of dwarven blacksmiths being able to forge metal from the tarrasque's underbelly by mixing it with adamantite and the creature's blood.[4]",

Also, unlike other great cats, tigers were great swimmers.[7] Tigers were excellent climbers and could jump long distances. They could jump 10\u202ffeet (3\u202fmeters) into the air and leap outward to ranges of 30 to 50\u202ffeet (9.1 to 15\u202fmeters).[5] These creatures typically hunted in pairs or family groups.[5] Tigers were a highly adaptable species, known to inhabit both tropical and subarctic forests across the Realms.[5][7] In South Faer\u00fbn, they inhabited the Ajmer Forest and the Forest of Amtar.[9] Beyond the Prime Material plane, like most mundane animals these creatures could be found in the Beastlands,[10] particularly on the layer of Brux.[11] Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue sold tiger hides for 25 gp a piece.[12]",

        "description": "   Treants typically had face-like features on their bark, a division between their trunk that formed legs, and long branches that served as arms.[1] Their wood appeared to be solid like stone, but it was actually filled with tubes that carried water from its roots to the areas where it was needed. Diseases such as tube wilt could affect these tubes and therefore the health of the treant.[8] In their adolescence treants were often more energetic, rebellious, and reckless.[9] But as they aged treants preferred to while away their days in quiet contemplation, rooted in place as though they were a normal tree.[1] Any treant that rooted itself in a stand containing a particular sort of tree for at least a year could, over a tenday or so, alter themselves to resemble and possess the physical properties of that type of tree. Certain elder treants were capable of doing this within half a tenday.[9] Treants remained aware of their surroundings while rooted in place. They could perceive the effects of events happening miles away based on subtle nearby changes.[1] Treants that came from the mightiest of trees could develop innate magical powers, allowing them to animate plants and call upon woodland creatures. Using them either as protectors or messengers.[1] According to the Encyclopaedia Deifica, the existence of treants in Faerun allegedly predated the arrival of elves and illithids.[10] The treants in the forest of Cormanthor became hosts for rot grubs, which lived off rotting wood. If a treant was affected by tube wilt, it would open up a small crack and let the grubs in. The grubs would eat through all the rotten wood, eating the fungi causing the disease, and usually remain for good and tackle subsequent rot. This relationship did not harm either party, and older, larger treants might contain up to a hundred of these grubs.[8] In order to ward off predators such as woodchucks or wood-eating horses, the Cormanthor treants surrounded their roots with up to six Cormanthor violet fungi, whose roots tapped into the treant itself, using its sap as sustenance, and they would attempt to rot the flesh of any would-be predators.[8] In order to combat the threat of bark beetles and leaf ants, which could damage the treant, they encourage azmyths and large bats to make their homes in their branches.[8] Black squirrels fed on the female treants' shoots, which helped to limit the treants' population.[8] The rimwood area contained birch-like treants with very long roots to reach water. The sap contained an aroma of lemon and mint that could be used as a flavoring or perfume. Most had rot grubs, black squirrels, azmyths, and purple fungi.[8] The midwood treants looked like golden willow and black locust trees. They protected themselves against brush rats by using the violet fungi. Their bark could be boiled to make either golden or black dye depending on their appearance.[8] The starwood area contained treants that looked like dark brown oaks and grey elms. Half were peaceful, but the other half were quite hostile, although they did utilize rot grubs, fungi, black squirrels, and azmyths. The leaves of these treants would cure certain fevers and plagues.[8] The treants that inhabited Maztica were fairly similar in appearance to those found in Faer\u00fbn, though they were not hostile to creatures foreign to their woods and instead preferred to ignore them. They considered themselves to be royalty of the forests they inhabited and expected other creatures to treat them as such, including giving them gifts.[11] Many young treants in the Western Heartlands resembled duskwoods, while those in their adolescence often chose to resemble bluewoods.[9] Trees destined to become treants meditated through a long cycle of seasons that could last decades or centuries, awakening only under special circumstances. Druids and other treants could sense this spark of potential within trees and would protect them as they drew near their moment of awakening. During this process a tree's body gradually morphed, taking on the features common among treants. After awakening, they continue to grow as they did when they were simply a tree.[1] Treants were generally capable of speaking Common, Elvish, Sylvan, and the Druidic language.[1] In addition, they had their own unique language.[3] Some treants willingly allowed sprites to build little villages within their boughs.[12] Treants were opposed to creatures that were careless with fire, poisoned trees, or destroyed great trees. Especially those that destroyed trees close to awakening into a treant.[1]",

        "description": "   Trolls were a ravenous, predatory species of giant humanoid found throughout almost all the regions and types of climates in Faer\u00fbn,[6] from arctic wastes to tropical jungles,[7] and came in several sub-species. They were uncivilized,[1] monstrous creatures with voracious appetites that roamed from one area to the next feeding upon whatever they could.[8] While some classified them as giants,[9] trolls had no confirmed relation to either Annam All-Father or Othea and did not qualify as either true giants or giant-kin. A typical adult troll stood around 9\u202ffeet (2.7\u202fmeters) tall on long, ungainly legs.[6] Some trolls grew even larger and these were referred to by some as fell trolls,[2] (not to be confused with the two-headed trolls with the same name.) Their deceptively thin bodies had thick, rubbery hides colored in shades of mossy green or putrid greys, and possessed long hanging arms that ended in massive claws. The skull of a troll had a messy, hair-like growth colored black or steel grey.[6] Females were typically larger, and more powerful, than males.[7] Although they walked upright, trolls possessed a severe hunch, which caused the backs of their hands to drag on the ground. When they ran, their arms dangled still. Despite their awkward physical appearance, trolls were surprisingly agile and were well adapted to be masterful climbers.[7] Most trolls were not overly territorial, except with their own kind.[10] Troll senses were unbalanced. They possessed poor hearing and a sensitivity to light, but superior olfactory senses.[7] A troll showing off its regenerative powers. Perhaps the most well-known factoid of trolls was their infamous regeneration. Whether a slash in its rubbery hide, or a dismembered limb, trolls could rapidly heal through most wounds. Only acid or fire could arrest the regeneration properties within a troll's flesh.[1] Dismembered limbs would continue to attack at opponents even after being severed.[7] Because of the regenerative properties of troll blood, it was extremely valuable. The blood that could be extracted from one troll was worth upwards of 400 gp. This green viscous liquid was used in the manufacture of poisons, antidotes and certain potions of healing.[7] Due to the adaptive nature of their physiology, trolls were especially susceptible to mutation. Although it was uncommon, actions taken throughout a troll's life could result in a physical or behavioral change, within the same generation.[1] When in heat, trolls exuded what was called \"mate-rut\" a foul-smelling to other species odor that signaled other trolls they were ready to breed. Experienced adventurers could recognize the smell from a distance.[11] Trolls hunted most other living creatures and were never concerned about the size or number of their prey.[8] They had absolutely no fear of death.[6] In combat, they flailed wildly with their clawed hands and used as a fierce bite, but seldom wielded weapons. On occasion they would throw large stones before closing the gap with their prey[7] Closeup of a troll's face. A troll foiling an adventurer's plans. Trolls had little in the way of society.[1] They traveled in non-migratory clans of 3-12[7] and, upon discovery of an area rich with prey,[8] would establish a lair, most often within a cave. They were often located near smaller human settlements, including established roads as those who traveled off the path served as a great source of food.[8] Once established within a region the band of trolls would hunt and devour as extensively as possible until all resources had been exhausted.[8] Although they could be encountered nearly anywhere, trolls were most often found in dense forests and subterranean locales,[7] including the Underdark,[10] and fed on whatever they get could rend with their claws.[8] Trolls were commonly found in a large number of areas that earned their name based on their populations, such as the Troll Mountains in Amn[22] and the similarly named Troll (or Trollcrag) Mountains in the Vast[23][24] as well as the Trollbark Forest.[25] Larger species of trolls, such as those found in Halruaa, and a species that were common in the areas surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars,[13] preferred mountainous areas.[16] A large, muscular type of troll was also found in the Utter East's Serpent Valley and Web Mountains; wielding massive clubs, they were territorial and typically guarded bridges and huts.[26] The smaller varieties tended to live more in the forests. The trolls of the Chondalwood, colloquially known as muskwarts were expert hunters within the region,[15] while the small and stealthy tree trolls originated from the Evermoors. Conflicts with giants caused their migration into the High Forest, where they fought against fey creatures such as pixies.[18] Troll dens were filthy places, led by a matriarchal shamanistic female.[7] This female-led dynamic extended into their faith as well, as each clan attributed their founding to an ancestor known as a great mother, which they believed was a daughter of the ogre-deity, Vaprak.[9] Trolls had no language of their own, but spoke giant[6] and \"trollspeak\", a guttural mix of common, orcish, goblin, and giant.[7] Any culture they possessed was passed down orally, usually kept within a single clan. Communication was often simple assertions for dominance or a mating female presenting a kill, along with a shared meal, to a prospective male.[10] Trolls and had no natural predators in the wild.[10] Though they were extremely difficult to tame, trolls were known to serve as mercenaries for more intelligent monstrous humanoids, such as ogres and giants.[1] Although they didn't fear humans when encountered, they respected them as a group that were known to wield fire, a weakness of theirs.[7] A wizard Huhhus developed a distilling process that could turn troll flesh into foul smelling and tasting potion of regeneration that was considered a failure due to no one wanting to actually consume that. Decades later, one of the wizard's students built upon Huhhus' work and developed a successful and profitable recipe to create rings of regeneration using troll's ichor and brain.[27] Another use for trolls was in creation of pearly white ioun stones, allegedly. It was believed that an enslaved troll soul was used in creation of this particular type of a regenerative ioun stone.[28] The origin of trolls was uncertain. However, if the trolls' legends were true that they originated from a number of daughters of Vaprak,[9] and if it was true that Vaprak was a son of Annam through the magical rape of an ogress enchantress,[29] then trolls were indeed descended from Annam All-Father as were other giants. The trolls also believed that they descended from a dark and primal Earth Mother.[9]",

        "description": "   A unicorn resembled a horse with a white coat, mane, and tail. However, it had a number of traits that distinguished it from a horse, including cloven hooves and a long ivory-colored horn that protruded from its forehead. Males had a white beard.[3] Unicorns were not subject to poison, death magic, or charm spells.[5] Unicorns were able to sense evil nearby and radiate an aura which protected them from most evil spells. A touch of the unicorn's horn could both heal wounds and cure poison.[3] Unicorns also had the ability to fey step to nearby locations.[2] A beautiful and graceful unicorn. There several varieties of unicorn recorded in Faerun besides the so-called \"regular\" unicorn (or sylvan unicorn, according to some scholars)[6]. Black unicorns were the evil counterparts of regular unicorns. They were created through magical breeding programs by the Red Wizards of Thay.[7] Celestial chargers were unicorns from Celestia that were the enemies of all evil creatures that would destroy woodlands.[3] Sea unicorns were a rumored variety of aquatic unicorn found in the Sea of Fallen Stars, resembling a hippocampus with a horn.[8] Additionally, there were certain depraved rituals that required removing the horn of a living unicorn. Most of the time, the unicorn so violated only survived a short time, but in some cases they went mad and, under a mild demonic influence, transformed into a horror called a bloodlance.[9] Unicorns attacked primarily by impaling foes on their horns, although they could also use their hooves as weapons.[2] Unicorns dwelt deep within their forests and shunned most creatures, only conferring with fey such as pixies, dryads, and sprites. They usually showed themselves only in defense of their forests.[3] They scratched glyphs into the bark of trees in the areas under their protection.[4] Unicorns mated for life.[3] Unicorns that rested at the Place of the Unicorn, sacred to the unicorn goddess Lurue, in the Sword Mountains were healed of all injury and disease.[10] A unicorn and its foal. At least 100 unicorns could be found in the High Forest[11], as well as a few down through the Unicorn Run.[12] Unicorns were most likely to be seen near the Sisters waterfalls, where seeing them and the moon rise above the cliffs were seen as a sign of good fortune from the goddess Mielikki.[11][13] Other locations home to unicorns included the Forgotten Forest.[13] Unicorns were often sent as servants of Corellon Larethian, Eldath, Isis, Labelas Enoreth, Lurue, Mielikki, Mystra, Rillifane Rallathil, Sheela Peryroyl, Silvanus, Solonor Thelandira, and Tymora to aid their worshipers.[14] Unicorn horns were reputed to have magical and healing properties.[2] They could be used in the production of antidotes and healing potions.[4] They could be sold to alchemists for thousands of gold pieces. However, there were many people in the Realms, particularly followers of Mielikki and Lurue, who were willing to punish slayers of unicorns with death.[15] Unicorn horns were considered a status symbol by wealthy demons of the Abyss. Theses gruesome items were used as post-meal toothpicks.[16] A cavalry of 50-100 \"unicornriders\" existed in ancient Cormanthyr.[17] During the Shoon Dynasty, rulers experimented on unicorns in an attempt to discover the secrets of eternal youth.[18] A herd of unicorns used to inhabit Shilmista before they and the elves that tended them were slaughtered in 355 DR by Necroqysar Shoon VII for use in the Tome of the Unicorn and the Staff of Shoon.[19] In the 1370s DR, inhumanely shackled and clamped unicorns could be found in the Stockyards of Samora, Azzagrat. The celestial beasts were chained and manacled around their necks to steaks driven deep into the ground. Heavy metal harnesses prevented these unicorns from teleporting away or even to be able to lift their heads. The unicorns were to be slaughtered and eaten by influential residents of the Abyss, namely by the Lady of the Counting-House, Maretta, Graz'zt's loyal servant.[16]",

Hit: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control. The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack.\nEach time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action. ",

Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.\nWhile in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight. If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.\nWhile it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point. The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn. The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. The vampire has the following flaws:\nForbiddance. The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.\nHarmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.\nStake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.\nSunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. ",

        "description": "   These vaporous creatures lurked in bogs, swamps, and other foggy areas where they could remain concealed and indistinguishable from the surrounding fog.[1] They were vaguely shaped like the upper body of humanoid figures whose fingers formed long tentacles through which the creatures fed.[4][3] Vampiric mists were the remains of former vampires that, whether through massive damage or exposure to sunlight, dissolved into mist and were prevented from returning to their resting places in order to regenerate their physical forms. In that state, they were stripped of all personality and intelligence until only their thirst for blood remained.[1] There were other legends that suggested that crimson deaths could be the lost souls of mortals that had been turned into vampires. Yet another legend suggested that crimson deaths were instead extremely evil air elementals that had been cursed and cast out of the Elemental Plane of Air.[4] The creatures originally known as vampiric mists, meanwhile, were first thought to be immature crimson deaths, but were later discovered to in fact be the separate creation of a great vampire wizard.[6] Due to their insatiable thirst, vampiric mists were inexorably attracted to the scent of blood, rushing towards any open wound or injury they could smell within one mile (1.6 km). Although vampiric mists were completely devoid of their previous intelligence or personality, they still retained some of the behavioral characteristics of vampires. For example, they could not enter a residence uninvited.[1] It was also possible to forge alliances with a vampiric mist, as long as a constant supply of victims was provided.[4] Vampiric mists avoided combat, except to feed or to defend themselves.[4] When attacking a creature, the mist's tentacles wrapped around its victim, causing its blood to escape through pores, eyes, nose or mouth, with no pain or discomfort caused to the victim.[1] Although they were virtually undetectable and very agile when not fed, once they started filling with blood they became progressively redder, until they became saturated with blood and started dripping it out.[1] In that state, they were more sluggish and much easier to detect.[5] Vampiric mists were known in legends throughout Faer\u00fbn. The sun elf vampire Jander Sunstar decided not to commit suicide for fear of becoming a vampiric mist.[7] Amidst the havoc of Halaster's Higharvestide in the Year of the Gauntlet, 1369 DR, the Sojourner's Portal in the House of the Moon became warped so that it worked the other way, and the mirror unleashed a crimson death and three vampiric mists from the depths of Undermountain into the heart of the temple. They hunted and slew a number of priests before they were stopped; the vampiric mists were swiftly destroyed, but the crimson death fled into the sewers of Waterdeep and was lost.[8] Vampiric mists were solitary and preferred to hunt solitary humanoids as well, which were easier to hunt and could not call for help. They usually required at least one victim per week. It was common for a vampiric mist to carry valuable belongings or the remains of its former victims into its lair to serve as bait for other prey.[4] If a vampiric mist were captured and imprisoned inside a container, it could pass for a genie prison or another form of magical vapor. If released, the mist would immediately attack whoever freed it.[4] Beyond the Prime Material plane, vampiric mists could be found in the Domains of Dread.[9] The crimson death and vampiric mist were originally two distinct creatures in 2nd edition, with the crimson death appearing alone in 1st and 3rd edition, and the vampiric mist appearing alone in 4th. Eventually, 5th edition merged them in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, with the line \"Vampiric mists, sometimes called crimson mists...\" and using the slain vampire origin of the crimson death. This leaves some discrepancies, with the additional creation stories of the vampiric mists and the creatures appearing separately in 2nd sources like Powers & Pantheons.",

        "description": "   Vampire spawn appeared as they did in life, though their features were hardened and appeared predatory.[3] A vampire spawn was innately subservient to the vampire that created it. They could only achieve free-will if their creator died[5] or if their creator voluntarily granted them freedom, but once free of their bondage a spawn could not be enslaved again.[6] Spawn typically believed they were superior to other living or undead creatures, regardless of how powerful a creature actually was.[7] When it came to a life of adventuring, vampire spawn would seek vengeance on their creators, or penance for their new damnation. If these monsters could overcome their ravenous emotions, they might seek out knowledge, glory, or power. Pride was the true driver of the vampire spawn, since they believed themselves better than others.[7] Vampire spawn did not possess all of the standard abilities of a true vampire, though they still suffered from the affections of all their traditional weaknesses and vulnerabilities.[7] Vampire spawn were the masters of stealth and charismatic cunning, easily standing their ground against any foe in combat. For them, battle was simple, because if they couldn't win through sheer force, they could vanish using abilities like gaseous form or spider climbing. Like most undead, their bite and touch caused blood drain and domination, making them terrible opponents of living beings.[7] Much like other intelligent undead, vampire spawn were rarely known to associate themselves with any religion.[7] Vampire spawn were often found in the Rauvin Vale and Sundabar Vale in the Silver Marches.[8] In the Demiplane of Dread, the vampire Strahd von Zarovich had numerous vampire spawn servants that either served at his castle or were hidden in settlements across Barovia. Many of these spawns were formerly consorts of his.[9] Besides true vampires, vampire spawn were often known to serve a variety of powerful undead, such as atropals and skull lords.[10] When acting of their own free will a vampire spawn were often known to garner other undead as soldiers, such as ghouls and wights, or bodyguards, such as mummies or mohrgs.[7]",

        "description": "   A vampire looked very much like it did when alive, but with paler skin, hardened and feral features giving them a predatory aspect, and red eyes that were hard to forget. Their hands were clawed.[4] They did not cast shadows and had no reflections in mirrors.[4] Vampires enjoyed fine things and engaging in decadent behavior, sharing such habits with liches. A vampire was always a creature of evil. If it was not evil in life, it became so in undeath.[4] A vampire retained all the abilities it had in life, and it gained the ability to drain blood and life energy, and to dominate other creatures with its gaze. A vampire could also command rats, bats, and wolves, or take the form of those creatures.[4] Vampires were eternally bound to their coffins and the unholy earth where they were buried.[4] Vampires could not tolerate the smell of garlic and would not voluntarily enter an area with a strong odor of it.[4] A new vampire was created when another vampire drained the life out of a living creature. A humanoid or monstrous humanoid could become a vampire.[4] Half-vampires could be created in one of two ways. First, in some rare cases, a vampire could consume enough blood that it could breed with a humanoid or monstrous humanoid, creating half-vampire offspring. Second, in even rarer cases, if a pregnant mother survived having her blood drained by a vampire, her unborn could be \"tainted\" with vampirism instead.[10] Master vampires were vampires that had perfected the art of taking spawn, and as a result, could lead large gangs of them. They usually had one chosen spawn that was much better than the others. However, all of a master vampire's spawn were better than the norm: stronger, faster, and more numerous.[11] Vampires typically plotted to empower themselves and produce spawn that would spread across the world.[4] The Lords of Darkness (1988) accessory described a \"greater vampire\" which was created from the life-draining kiss of a succubus. A greater vampire had all the abilities of a lesser vampire and could also move about freely in daylight, allowing it to take on the persona of a normal person, usually a wealthy individual. During the hours of daylight, the greater vampire retained its superior strength and spell immunities but could not use any of its special abilities such as life-drain, shapeshifting, or gaseous form.[12] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

Combat veterans early on learn to keep their soldiers moving and out of danger, barking out a movement order on the spur of the moment. Combat veterans are also more durable, their bodies acclimatized to the perils of combat. As such, combat veterans more frequently recover from their wounds than most other warriors as well as healing more quickly. All combat veterans also gain, as a result, at least a rudimentary knowledge of battlefield medicine, which they use to help allies stave off ill effects during combat, particularly in concert with their inspiring word exploit.[1] The exploits of a combat veteran rely more on internalized knowledge of combat than knowledge learned out of a book. For instance, skirmish ploy is a technique used by combat veterans to daze a foe and then thrust the injured enemy into the path of an ally, quickening the damage dealt to the foe. Superior tactics is another example, built upon the wealth of experience that a long-lived combat veteran has, which allows a combat veteran to take advantage of an enemy\u2019s weakness for both the foe\u2019s ill and the allies of the combat veteran\u2019s good fortune, inspiring them to rapid action.

They could range in color from deep purple to dull gray, or they could be violet and covered in purple spots.[2] They also contained four leafy tendrils.[4][2] The length of these tendril branches varied depending upon the size of the specimen, with some of the smallest only having tendrils that were 1\u202ffoot (0.3\u202fmeters) in length.[4] Prior to the Spellplague, these creatures bore a close resemblance to the fungi known as shriekers.[2][4][3] Violet fungi could sense nearby motion and would flail their appendages at creatures nearby. They would feed on decaying matter, often from the bodies of creatures that came too close and had succumbed to their poison.[2] The four leafy tendrils on violet fungi secreted a sort of poison that caused weakening when applied to other creatures.[2] Prior to the Time of Troubles, this poison was said to be capable of rotting flesh.[4] Cormanthorian violet fungi grew only to around 3 feet (0.9 meters) high. They were often used by treants, who would surround their roots with up to six of these fungi. The fungi's roots tapped into the treant for sustenance, and they helped to protect it against bark-eaters by flailing with tentacles, attempting to rot the predators' flesh.[6] Violet fungi was typically found underground, in areas such as the Underdark.[5] They were most often growing from the decomposing bodies of animals.[4] In the Abyss, violet fungi could be found in Shedaklah, the Slime Pits, 222nd layer of the Abyss.[7] Violet fungi had a symbiotic relationship with shriekers, another closely related fungus species,[2] and often grew interspersed with them in patches.[2][4] The shriekers' noise would benefit a violet fungus by drawing curious creatures near enough for the violet fungus to poison.[2] 427 DR was known as the Year of Violet Fungi.[8]",

        "description": "   Vrocks stood 8\u202ffeet (240\u202fcentimeters) tall and weighed 500\u202fpounds (230\u202fkilograms), appearing as a cross between a vulture and a human. Their bodies were twisted and gnarly with a long neck and limbs all covered in sinew. The parts of their body not covered in sinew, especially their broad wings, were coated with small gray feathers, and their body stunk of offal and carrion. Their bestial appearance was magnified by their long talons and vulture heads,[3][1] but burning in their terrifying eyes could be seen a keen, predatory intelligence.[8] Once thought to be loyal only to their own kind, vrocks turned out to be treacherous even towards each other, betraying their fellows for simple, cheap jewels.[4] They were capricious in the extreme, only working together due to their ability to coordinate, and were well-known for abandoning their jobs and joining with new masters they believed to be more powerful.[1] Vrocks were dull-witted demons,[1] but smart enough to keep an eye out for targets.[8] Trying to bribe them was normally a mistake, as they also harbored a strong, demonic bloodlust, relishing the screams of their victims and the taste of humanoid flesh. They saw no reason to accept a bargain when they could simply kill the diplomat, take his treasure, and then have the added benefit of sating their need for carnage and having a fresh meal.[1] A strange set of supernatural abilities aided the vrocks in their violent endeavors. Every now and then vrocks could emit a bloodcurdling screech so loud it caused those nearby physical pain when they heard it, sending them into a short daze.[4] Vrocks could try to summon another vrock or a small legion of dretches each day, with limited success for each type.[1] They were reported to have access to the spell-like abilities darkness, desecrate, detect good, detect magic, mass charm, mirror image, telekinesis, and teleport without error.[3] When a vrocks' wings were shook, small glands scattered across them could release a cloud of tiny spores that would spread about the nearby vicinity and burrow under the skin of those nearby. From that point, they would grow into thick vine-like structures for a short time and poison the victim, eating away at their skin. Poison diminishing magic or the sprinkling of holy water could stop their effects. If allowed to run its course, assuming the victim survived that long, they stopped causing pain after a few minutes at most, and would wither away in a few days.[8][4] However, the most dreadful ability of the vrocks was their Dance of Ruin. When enough vrocks of a certain combined strength gathered together, generally between 3-5, they could begin a dangerous rite through wild dancing and chanting in an ancient language. With their talons joined together and eldritch screeching filling the air, the vrocks could craft a weave of crackling, lightning-like energy that would engulf the nearby vicinity in a flash of light and destroy everything within several hundred feet.[8][4] Vrocks were the terrors of the Abyssal skies,[8] dangerous fiends that pranced merrily through the air, gleefully ripping apart their quarry with beak and claw. Like birds of prey, they soared above the battlefields in search of suitable victims to swoop down upon and savage. They were smart enough to use mirror image to create the illusion that there was more of them than there were, and telekinesis to pin their enemies, launch them into the air,[8] or drop heavy objects from above.[11] Their screeching was normally used as a prelude to escape rather than an introductory tactic due to its difficulty,[4] and though they preferred flight, they could also teleport to reposition themselves.[8] However, the natural tendencies of vrocks could end up working against them. Despite their build and abilities being more suited to mobile combat, their deep need for carnage and general idiocy threw them deep into the heart of melee.[4][3][8] This single-minded and insatiable desire for combat could be actively used in their enemy's favor. In their reckless pursuit of conflict, a vrock could be lured away from its group by a seemingly vulnerable victims only to be lured into an ambush where they were outnumbered and outmatched, blasted from the safety of cover by hidden foes.[8] There were multiple proposed reasons why vrocks did not use their devastating Dance of Ruin ability more often. It was thought that the dance could potentially harm the vrocks as well as any others within the vicinity, although this was a contested belief. Others traced it to the vrocks own unwillingness to cooperate, love for carnage and general stupidity. If another vrock was in danger it was all the more treasure for the others to take, and so it was only done if they were all mutually threatened. The dance also took a considerable amount of time to perform and being stopped in any way, either from pain or other restraints, would force them to start over.[3][4] Despite their many flaws, vrocks were intelligent enough to employ effective group tactics, making them more dangerous than other demonic brutes.[8] Once they started cooperating, a flock of vrocks was capable of being an elite fighting force with coordinated attacks of such perfect timing that even devils would have to take notice.[12][4] A pair of vrocks being led into battle by a more powerful tanar'ri. A gathering of vrocks was known as a \"murder\", and the size of the group could vary wildly. Typically they moved in groups of under eight members, but they were known to organize into squadrons of ten and perhaps greater numbers in times of war.[12][3][4] Vrocks were employed as guards, elite assault troops, infiltrators, and covert operatives due to their quality skills in these tasks. This was despite the fact that they were known to scheme against their superiors, as they were not so intellectual as to be likely to succeed.[8][4] They were still carefully watched for disloyalty however, as they were likely to switch sides without any notice.[2] Although they made excellent bodyguards and enforcers for stronger and smarter demons, vrocks truly came into their own during massed battles as aerial strike teams. They flew above enemy forces with various debris in tow, raining rocks and the like down upon their foes before plunging into the fray.[8] Among other demons, vrocks had a poor relationship with chasmes, another group of flying tanar'ri. The two mutually hated one another, the chasme seeing the vrocks as rivals.[13] Vrocks also had a bitter feud with bulezaus, who they rivaled as the toughest front-line troops of the tanar'ri. The bulezaus lacked the magic and mobility of a vrock band, but compensated with sheer stubbornness and fury that led them to never stop fighting. The two bloodthirsty demon breeds would almost inevitably fight upon meeting, unless baatezu were present for them to attack instead.[14] Besides demons themselves, vrocks would associate with demonic cults, as well as evil fey and wicked giants.[2] Vrocks followed a peculiar system when it came to learning magic. No matter how intelligent, individual vrocks couldn't become wizards, but a collective of five or more could. The downside of this was that all vrocks had to study a spell before any of them could cast it, but this was compensated for by their increased group adeptness, since a murder of vrocks had the spellcasting strength of some of the most powerful mages.[15] A lone vrock in an environment befitting its disposition. Vrocks were wrought from the ancient sins of hatred and wrath in mortal souls confined to the Abyss.[16] When other demons transformed into vrocks, they first entered an egg form. Though the egg could be stopped from hatching, if it did, the new vrock would emerge fully formed.[9] Vrock feathers could be used as evil spell components.[17] Freshly killed vrocks, assuming they didn't melt into goop upon death or weren't otherwise destroyed, could be harvested for spores within ten minutes of their demise. Though they didn't have the lingering effects of fresh spores, harvested ones were still a dangerous poison.[8] As unlikely as it might seem, the vrocks were far more reliable than they once were. There was once a race of ancient vrocks more powerful and magically adept than their modern variants that were nearly wiped out two millennia ago. When one of their leaders brought down the wrath of a powerful demon lord they were practically driven to extinction and supplanted by the more controllable lesser vrocks.[18] In 882 DR, Prince Simberuel Astalm\u00e9 of Ascalhorn was killed by vrocks while protecting the dwarven Forgemaster of Sundbarr in the Turnstone Pass.[19] In 1373 DR, there were at least two vrocks serving Matron Mother Yasraena Dyrr of House Agrach Dyrr in Menzoberranzan. The vrocks were polymorphed as drow so as not to cause suspicion.[20] In 1485\u20131486 DR, vrocks were some of the more common demons roaming the streets of Menzoberranzan. They were involved in the failed defense of Q'Xorlarrin against the dwarves seeking to reclaim Gauntlgrym.[21] Tanar'ri\nAdaru \u2022 Alkilith \u2022 Armanite \u2022 Arrow demon \u2022 Babau \u2022 Balor \u2022 Bar-lgura \u2022 Bulezau \u2022 Cerebrilith \u2022 Chasme \u2022 Dretch \u2022 Gadacro \u2022 Glabrezu \u2022 Goristro \u2022 Hezrou \u2022 Jovoc \u2022 Kastighur \u2022 Klurichir \u2022 Lilitu \u2022 Mane \u2022 Marilith \u2022 Maurezhi \u2022 Mavawhan \u2022 Molydeus \u2022 Myrmyxicus \u2022 Nabassu \u2022 Nalfeshnee \u2022 Palrethee \u2022 Rutterkin \u2022 Solamith \u2022 Sorrowsworn \u2022 Spyder-fiend \u2022 Succubus \u2022 Uridezu \u2022 Vrock \u2022 Yochlol\nObyriths\nDraudnu \u2022 Ekolid \u2022 Golothoma \u2022 Laghathti \u2022 Sibriex \u2022 Uzollru \u2022 Verakia \u2022 Wastrilith",

        "description": "   Vultures were large birds with filthy feathers. Their main distinguishing feature was their featherless pink head.[2] Vultures were considered to be cowardly animals.[2] Upon sighting anything on the ground that appeared injured or dead, a vulture would quickly swoop down to investigate.[3] Vultures had an acute, long distance vision.[4] Their keen eyesight is comparable to that of any eagle, falcon, or hawk.[3] Being carrion eaters, they developed the ability to consume infected, poisoned or rotting meat safely.[2] A female vulture could lay up to four eggs at a time. These eggs were incubated over a period of two months until they hatched. A young vulture could fly at four months of age.[2] Vultures were scavengers, attacking prey only once it has died or collapsed from exhaustion. Vultures only attacked moving prey if in a group, and only if the prey was already near collapsing.[2] Vultures typically lived in flocks.[2] These creatures were carrion eaters. They fed upon creatures that were either injured or already dead. Though they were also liable to attack creatures that were unconscious, restrained, or sleeping.[3] Vultures typically inhabited high altitudes, such as mountains, within temperate or tropical regions.[3] They were usually encountered in warm areas, floating on updrafts over open spaces.[2] In the Hordelands they could be found in the Katakoro Plateau, the Raurin and Quoya Deserts, and among its many mountain ranges.[7] In the Zakhara region's Crowded Sea, they could be found on the island chain of Nada al-Hazan[8] and the archipelago of Jazayir al-Sartan.[9] Beyond the Prime Material plane, vultures could be found in the plane of Acheron.[10] Vultures were a symbol and favored animal of Thasmudyan, the god of undeath in the Zakharan pantheon.[11] Evil swanmays sometimes shapechanged into the form of a vulture.[12] The bones and feathers of a vulture were used as material components in the casting of some spells.[13][14]",

        "description": "   Horses were classified in a number of different manners. Chargers, or more plainly warhorses were those horses bred to ride in battle.[9] Light warhorses were referred to as coursers while heavy warhorses were known as destriers.[10] Some of the best-trained horses were trained by the elven House Korianthil.[11] Horses were considered sacred to many faiths of Faer\u00fbn. Warhorses were important to followers of Anhur, the Red Knight, and Tempus. Pinto and piebald horses were particularly favored by Deneir; palomino horses to Waukeen. Gray-haired horsed were sacred to Mask, while white ones were sacred to Milil, and chestnut-colored horses to Sune. Mystra favored donkeys, horses, and mules with blue or mismatched eyes. Intelligent horses were also native to the celestial realms of Sehanine Moonbow.[12] Horses were a kind of novelty for Thymari dragonborn, as such beasts weren't common in Abeir. As such, horses, specially warhorses were highly valued by Thymari, who cared for them as precious friends.[13] A white horse was the symbol for the sun elf house of Evanara.[14]",

They could easily disappear within a body of water, becoming indistinguishable from all other liquid.[8] These beings were not especially intelligent.[6] However, like all elementals, they instinctively resented any creature that conjured them from their home plane and bound them into its service.[8] Being elementals, these creatures did not require any air, food, drink, or sleep to survive.[8] Though they had a highly developed sense of taste.[9] Due to being composed of water, these elementals could effortlessly move through spaces as small as 1\u202finch (0.025\u202fmeters). However, cold-based spells considerably restrained their movement.[1] Prior to the Time of Troubles, water elementals were only capable of straying 6\u202ffeet (1.8\u202fmeters) away from their element.[6] Following this period and prior to the Spellplague, they were only capable of moving 180\u202ffeet (55\u202fmeters) from the body of water in which they were originally conjured.[5] Following the events of the Second Sundering, there were no longer any limits on how far water elementals could stray from bodies of water.[1] Acid, as well as bludgeoning and piercing weaponry, was ineffective against water elementals. They could only be harmed by weaponry that was enchanted.[1] Prior to the Time of Troubles, they could only be damaged by weapons with a +2 enchantment or greater.[6] Water elementals preferred to fight in bodies of water. They were capable of capsizing small boats and could impede the progress of larger craft.[10][6] Outside of water they were slower and less effective combatants.[6] Water elementals would often attempt to grapple a larger creature or multiple smaller ones, restraining them within their watery body in an attempt to drown the victim(s).[1][8] When not attempting this, water elementals would simply slam their bodies against opponents.[1] Water elementals were used in the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym to help contain the fire primordial Maegera.[11] Lucan Greenharrow used water elementals to power traps in the Waterclock Crypts of Neverwinter.[12] These beings were native to the Elemental Plane of Water.[6] On the Prime Material plane, they were occasionally encountered in the oceans around Kara-Tur.[13] Prior to the Time of Troubles, a pool of water that was at least 1,000\u202fcubic feet (28\u202fcubic meters) in volume was required to summon a water elemental to the Prime Material plane, but several barrels of ale or wine would also suffice.[6] Following this period, more effective means for summoning water elementals were available. These included the spells elemental summoning[14] and conjure water elemental.[15] There were also magical items that could achieve this, such as as a bowl of commanding water elementals and elemental gems.[16] Water elementals spoke Aquan, although they rarely chose to speak.[5][1] Water elementals were favored monsters of the deities Deep Sashelas, Istishia, and Auril. Because of this, they would often act as servitors of these deities and their worshipers.[17] Water elementals were often summoned by krakens to defend their lairs.[18] Some acted as servants of the marid Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari in her Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls.[19]",

As well as in its more arctic regions.[7] These animals could be trained and domesticated.[4][5] And some wizards were known to have them as familiars.[8] Weasels were a favored animal of the deities Garagos, Garl Glittergold, and Thoth.[9] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

        "description": "   Werebear humanoid forms were often large, heavily muscled, and covered in hair. Their hair was thick and shaggy with males typically having beards, and hair color ranged from brown, black, and blonde to even red or ivory. Werebears dressed in simple garments that could be easily removed. Their ursine forms most often resembled a brown bear,[2] although their human form's hair always matched their bear form's fur color,[1] with brown being common in forest regions and ivory being common in frozen regions.[citation needed] They also possessed a hybrid form that resembled a bipedal bear with paws and long claws.[2] Most werebears were good-natured and desired to help others in their communities.[citation needed] They saw themselves as the guardians standing between the natural world and civilization.[1] In order to prevent themselves from harming others they controlled their savagery and isolated themselves.[1] When in bear form they were irritable and moody, actively seeking out evil entities to slay.[2] They were particularly hateful of evil lycanthropes,[citation needed] although a small few were just as evil as them.[1] No matter the form, werebears had an especially keen sense of smell.[1] Werebears typically armed themselves with weapons like greataxes and throwing axes[2] and knives along with other weapons that had practical utility, although had a preference for those that allowed them to use their strength. They would only use their bear or hybrid forms if they were at risk of death. When in their bear forms, werebears grew much larger, and showed an increase in their ability to climb and swim.[1] It also granted them a strong hold, grasping enemies between their paws with incredible ease.[2] Werebears in hybrid form could choose between wielding an axe, or slashing at their enemies with their claws.[2] Despite their strong teeth, they refused to bite into their opponents to avoid the chance of transforming them.[1] Like all lycanthropes they could not be harmed by normal weaponry in their transformed states, requiring silver or magical weapons to permanently harm them. They could also call any bear within a mile radius to their location. Werebears were mostly likely to become rangers, druids or wildlife priests.[4] Werebears were mostly solitary, living in forest near waterways on the outskirts of civilization. Like most lycanthropes there were true and infected members of the species, with the former being born and their status irreversible, and the latter being turned by another member of the species through bite. Females would bear 1 or 2 children in human form with the children being born appearing humanoid until they turned eight. After this point they would gain the ability to transform into large shaggy bears, and the mother would chase the adolescents away to continue the cycle. Normal werebears claimed territories between 1-4 miles in size, and felt a close bond to their homes. They possessed a natural empathy with other ursines and could bond with them more easily.[4] Transformed individuals gained an incredible boost in physical power even in their human forms.[1] Like normal bears, werebears were omnivores, preferring to eat small mammals and fish. They also enjoyed a type of honey rich mead, although it was highly intoxicated to normal humanoids. They had few natural predators but were the enemies of evil lycanthropes, primarily the werewolves of which they commonly shared territory with, but also wererats.[4] Contrary to their isolationist behavior and independent lifestyle, werebears had a strong sense of community. They never attacked each other, allowed other werebears access to their fishing zones, and defended werebears from other lycanthropes. New adolescent werebears were usually guided by older werebears.[4] They would only pass on their curses to willing companions and associates, personally training them to temper their bestial urges.[1] They acted as wardens of their territories, protecting the wilderness[1] from ravagers and over-hunters and almost never entered villages outside of emergencies or to assist the forces of good, especially against evil lycanthropes.[citation needed] They were largely sedentary, rarely traveling away from their homes and hard to convince to leave them. Only rarely could they be persuaded to join adventuring parties; the young were most likely to do so, and would only act as guides for proper payment. Werebears hid their treasures in their homes, often consisting of coins, gems, and other valuable items. They also collected magical items like potions or scrolls as rewards for service, although they destroyed those designed to effect bears or lycanthropes so that they could not be used against them. Werebears had favored mates they would meet with infrequently, although they never actually married. Some lived in small families of 2\u20134, occasionally with wild bears. They preferred to live in cabins near abundant sources of water.[4] In north Faer\u00fbn, werebears could be found in the forests of Mistledale, Shadowdale, and around the Pool of Yeven.[6] In the Unapproachable East, werebears could be found in the interior uplands and Yuirwood of Aglarond,[7] as well as within the forests of Rashemen.[8]",

        "description": "   A wereboar tended to be a stocky, muscular individual of average height, 5\u20136 feet (1.5\u20131.8 meters), with short stiff hair or fur. Wereboars had three forms: a boar, the normal form of whatever creature it was normally, and that of a humanoid/boar hybrid with tusks.[5][3][2][1] The hybrid form was a little taller than the humanoid form but twice as wide, and had a hunchbacked frame so the head extended forward on a shorter neck. The head was just like a boar's, including short tusks. Their hide was covered in black hair as stiff as wire bristles, and their feet turned into hooves. They were considered ugly in any form.[5] They usually wore simple clothes they could easily take off when changing or readily repair or replace if they were torn.[3][5] As lycanthropes, wereboars could shift between their three forms: boar, humanoid, and hybrid. They had all the common traits of lycanthropes. They were stronger and tougher than they would be otherwise.[1][2][3][5][6] Their particular strain of lycanthropy was transmitted via goring with their tusks.[1][3] It could also transfer a sickness called \"moontusk fever\", weakened the victim's resistances while it was wounded.[2] They were capable of empathic communication with their boar kin, from normal boars to dire boars. They also had a keen sense of smell.[3] Ferocious as regular boars, they were able to charge a foe and gore their targets with their tusks, potentially dealing terrible injuries and pushing them back or knocking them prone.[3][2][1] They enjoyed throwing their weight around in close-quarters combat, and took any chance they got to adopt their boar or hybrid forms.[2] A common tactic was to grab a foe, gore them with a tusk, then thrust their head to one side as they threw the victim to the other, tearing the wound wider, before going after another target. A wereboar was apt to fight their way into the midst of an enemy group, then fight their way out.[5] These creatures were relentless in battle; even on the verge of death, they would still fight on, none the weaker.[3][4][1] When injured, they fought all the harder, and even at the point of death they might make a dying blow.[2] When in their humanoid and hybrid forms, they favored chopping and bludgeoning weapons like axes and maces,[5] heavy weapons such as mauls,[2][1] or battleaxes together with javelins,[3] or just whatever came to hand. They rarely took up stabbing weapons like spears or swords or missile weapons like bows.[5] They often wore hide armor.[2] Wereboars were bad-tempered, volatile, brutish, and crude.[6][5][2][1] They provoked conflicts and looked for fights in taverns and on the streets, and it didn't take much for them to transform into hybrid form.[2] In human form, they might wait for another to attack first, but in boar they attacked first, more often than not, driving away trespassers and attacking those who tried to defend themselves.[5] They were almost as likely to attack a friend as a foe.[5] They were wary of strangers, assuming everyone else was hostile.[5][1] but did not care who they infected with their lycanthropy, enjoying that the more their victim struggled against it, the more of a savage animal they became.[1] Despite this, wereboars made for useful allies in battle. They rarely and reluctantly made friends, but when they did, it was an unbreakable bond. However, because of their personalities, it was hard to know whether a wereboar was being friendly or not.[5] They formed small, close-knit family groups.[5][1] Female wereboars had litters of 3 to 6 young, smaller than human babies but strong and capable of crawling in only hours. They matured swiftly, entering adolescence at age 8, when they were able to transform. Wereboar mothers and fathers alike were fierce and fearless protectors of their families; females were even more aggressive in protecting their children. Fathers generally seemed aloof and distant, otherwise.[5] They were usually encountered alone, in pairs, broods of three or four, or in troupes of up to four[3] or even groups as large as eight.[6][5] They avoided natural hogs and boars,[5] only seldom mingling with them.[6] However, a troupe might have up to four companion boards.[3] Wereboars usually dwelled in dense woodlands or similar environments, remote from cities and towns.[6][5][1] Here, they made their homes in ramshackle huts or cabins or simply moved into caves.[5][1] Either way, these were messy and dirty, and if something broke, the wereboars replaced it rather repair it. They produced few goods or services of any noticeable value.[5] Omnivorous, wereboars ate small game, vegetables, and fungi, and they particularly enjoyed truffles, able to scent them growing even several feet below ground. However, they were terrible farmers and gardeners, usually just throwing various bulbs and seeds over a cleared field and hoping something would grow that they could eat. Wereboar cuisine was more or less just stews and burnt meat.[5] They spoke Common, though not in boar form.[2][1] Wereboars of the Black Blood hunting their prey. Wereboars fitted orc society as much as they did human society.[5] They occasionally allied with orcs[5][1] and they tolerated half-orcs.[5] Orc wereboars, in turn, could be formidable champions of their tribes.[4] Some wereboars joined the People of the Black Blood, a cult of Malar-worshiping lycanthropes. Thanks to their physical strength, they readily became Bloodmasters.[7] Some 22 Black Blood wereboars laired at Claw Hollow around 1372 DR.[8] In the mid\u201314th century DR, wereboars might be found in the starwoods region of Cormanthor.[9] In the Silver Marches, they might be found in the Moonlands and in Adbar Vale, Cold Vale, Rauvin Vale, and Sundabar Vale.[10] The Forest of Mir was home to a contented settlement of wereboars and wild boars in its southeast. A more ambitious and organized colony was established in the Spider Swamp.[11] In the Year of the Keening Gale, 1050 DR, the family of Prince Natan of Tethyr was attacked by three wereboars. The prince died saving his family.[14]",

        "description": "   Werebear humanoid forms were often large, heavily muscled, and covered in hair. Their hair was thick and shaggy with males typically having beards, and hair color ranged from brown, black, and blonde to even red or ivory. Werebears dressed in simple garments that could be easily removed. Their ursine forms most often resembled a brown bear,[2] although their human form's hair always matched their bear form's fur color,[1] with brown being common in forest regions and ivory being common in frozen regions.[citation needed] They also possessed a hybrid form that resembled a bipedal bear with paws and long claws.[2] Most werebears were good-natured and desired to help others in their communities.[citation needed] They saw themselves as the guardians standing between the natural world and civilization.[1] In order to prevent themselves from harming others they controlled their savagery and isolated themselves.[1] When in bear form they were irritable and moody, actively seeking out evil entities to slay.[2] They were particularly hateful of evil lycanthropes,[citation needed] although a small few were just as evil as them.[1] No matter the form, werebears had an especially keen sense of smell.[1] Werebears typically armed themselves with weapons like greataxes and throwing axes[2] and knives along with other weapons that had practical utility, although had a preference for those that allowed them to use their strength. They would only use their bear or hybrid forms if they were at risk of death. When in their bear forms, werebears grew much larger, and showed an increase in their ability to climb and swim.[1] It also granted them a strong hold, grasping enemies between their paws with incredible ease.[2] Werebears in hybrid form could choose between wielding an axe, or slashing at their enemies with their claws.[2] Despite their strong teeth, they refused to bite into their opponents to avoid the chance of transforming them.[1] Like all lycanthropes they could not be harmed by normal weaponry in their transformed states, requiring silver or magical weapons to permanently harm them. They could also call any bear within a mile radius to their location. Werebears were mostly likely to become rangers, druids or wildlife priests.[4] Werebears were mostly solitary, living in forest near waterways on the outskirts of civilization. Like most lycanthropes there were true and infected members of the species, with the former being born and their status irreversible, and the latter being turned by another member of the species through bite. Females would bear 1 or 2 children in human form with the children being born appearing humanoid until they turned eight. After this point they would gain the ability to transform into large shaggy bears, and the mother would chase the adolescents away to continue the cycle. Normal werebears claimed territories between 1-4 miles in size, and felt a close bond to their homes. They possessed a natural empathy with other ursines and could bond with them more easily.[4] Transformed individuals gained an incredible boost in physical power even in their human forms.[1] Like normal bears, werebears were omnivores, preferring to eat small mammals and fish. They also enjoyed a type of honey rich mead, although it was highly intoxicated to normal humanoids. They had few natural predators but were the enemies of evil lycanthropes, primarily the werewolves of which they commonly shared territory with, but also wererats.[4] Contrary to their isolationist behavior and independent lifestyle, werebears had a strong sense of community. They never attacked each other, allowed other werebears access to their fishing zones, and defended werebears from other lycanthropes. New adolescent werebears were usually guided by older werebears.[4] They would only pass on their curses to willing companions and associates, personally training them to temper their bestial urges.[1] They acted as wardens of their territories, protecting the wilderness[1] from ravagers and over-hunters and almost never entered villages outside of emergencies or to assist the forces of good, especially against evil lycanthropes.[citation needed] They were largely sedentary, rarely traveling away from their homes and hard to convince to leave them. Only rarely could they be persuaded to join adventuring parties; the young were most likely to do so, and would only act as guides for proper payment. Werebears hid their treasures in their homes, often consisting of coins, gems, and other valuable items. They also collected magical items like potions or scrolls as rewards for service, although they destroyed those designed to effect bears or lycanthropes so that they could not be used against them. Werebears had favored mates they would meet with infrequently, although they never actually married. Some lived in small families of 2\u20134, occasionally with wild bears. They preferred to live in cabins near abundant sources of water.[4] In north Faer\u00fbn, werebears could be found in the forests of Mistledale, Shadowdale, and around the Pool of Yeven.[6] In the Unapproachable East, werebears could be found in the interior uplands and Yuirwood of Aglarond,[7] as well as within the forests of Rashemen.[8]",

Such cubs were born in their hybrid state, though would appear human if born to a human mother. They matured at a faster rate than humans, crawling within days and walking within a month. At age 6 they were capable of transforming into a fully humanoid form and at age 12 gained access to their full-tiger forms.[4] Some, though not all, giant races were susceptible to this form of lycanthropy.

Lycanthropes in animal or hybrid form fight like the animal they resemble. Weretigers can assume a hybrid form as well as an animal form. In hybrid or tiger form, they can pounce and grab just as normal tigers do. Alternate Form (Su): A weretiger can assume a bipedal hybrid form or the form of a tiger. The bipedal form is about 7 feet tall, with a 3-foot tail, and covered by tiger-striped hide. The legs are more feline than human, and this form walks on its toes. The fingernails grow into claws. The head is a mixture of features: Ears, nose, muzzle, and teeth are tigerlike, but the eyes and overall shape are human. If the human form's hair is long, it is still present. The animal form is that of a fully grown tiger without any trace of human features. Pounce (Ex): Ifs weretiger in hybrid or tiger form leaps upon a foe during the first round of combat, it can make a full attack even if it has already taken a move action. Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability the weretiger in hybrid or tiger form must hit with a claw or bite attack. If it gets a hold, it can rake. Rake (Ex): A weretiger in hybrid or rigor form that gets a hold can make two rake attacks (+9 melee) with its hind legs for 1d8+3 damage each. If the weretiger pounces on an opponent, it can also rake. Skills: In hybrid or tiger form, weretigers receive a +4 bonus to Balance, Hide, and Move Silently checks. In areas of tall grass or heavy undergrowth, the Hide bonus improves to +8. A shapechanger has the supernatural ability to assume one or more alternate forms. Many magical effects allow some kind of shape shifting, and not every creature that can change shapes has the shapechanger subtype.

        "description": "   A review of white dragon anatomy. White dragons were physically the smallest of the chromatic dragons, even smaller than black dragons. They appeared in shades from white to grey and ice-blue, and in arctic environments, this appearance served as good camouflage.[8] White dragons were physically distinguished by several features: their heads and necks seemed to blend seamlessly into one another, and their wings appeared somewhat frayed along the edges. They had a flap of skin, called a dewlap, lined with spines beneath their chins. Their heads were very streamlined, and they had high crests atop their skulls. They had a crisp, vaguely chemical odor.[citation needed] White dragon toes were spaced more widely than those of other dragons, with barbed claws to aid movement on ice. Their very thin eyelids prevented snowblindness when observing arctic landscapes.[8] When in the stage of being a wyrmling, white dragons had a less pronounced crest and small stubs where their future horns would be. They completely lacked the dewlap and their bodies were protected by a leathery white hide in place of scales.[9] White dragons were not strong combatants as dragons went, but they were not to be underestimated. Their icy breath could freeze an unprepared foe solid in an instant. They typically avoided fights with more powerful dragons, but would avail themselves of any opportunity to take their frustrations out on \"lesser\" creatures.[citation needed] Whites also had exceptional memories,[8] and would often hunt down beings who crossed them, no matter how long it might take.[citation needed] They were not as cruel as black dragons and were not as ferocious as reds, but they were still competent in combat.[8] White dragons preferred to attack first, then eat their prey, rather than pausing to ask questions. They did not often contemplate what to eat, simply choosing the most convenient prey, and would often freeze it after the kill by burying it in snow or ice for days.[8] White dragons expelled a cone of intense cold, a direct hit from which was fatal as it instantly froze its victim. Even a glancing blow could be seriously debilitating.[citation needed] A white dragon nest. They were still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and had exceptional long-term memories. Adult white dragons had several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat: they could climb ice cliffs with ease, fly very high and fast, and were exceptional swimmers. They loved to swim in cold water; the more frigid, the better. Much of their diet consisted of aquatic creatures, even whales.[8] White dragons were always hungry, and tended to become more savage as they matured. Knowing that they were the smallest and weakest of dragons, many whites harbored inferiority complexes. They took any opportunity to bully beings such as giants and younger dragons of other species.[citation needed] White dragons preferred to scavenge for and collect treasure, rather than involving themselves in politics as other dragons might. Like other dragons, they looked down on others, and tended to view other creatures as prey.[8] Most white dragons laired in ice caves, often dug into the side of an arctic mountain, on tundra, or glacial plains, although they did not need ice and snow, and some settled near mountain peaks or in forests. They could create their own caves by applying the breath weapon to tightly packed snow in order to transform it into solid ice.[8] White dragons made their homes in frozen lands and ice-covered mountains. Their lairs often contained many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. More powerful white dragons would sometimes turn a large iceberg into a floating lair. Such lairs always had an underwater entrance as well as one to the open air.[citation needed] Whites preferred glittery treasure that resembled ice, such as diamonds or light gems, but platinum, silver, and anything reflective or polished works of art were also popular.[8] Back when her domains included winter, some white dragons were known to worship the Raven Queen.[10] The wyrmling Calcryx in her underground lair near Thundertree. White dragons usually laid about eight or ten eggs in a clutch. A white dragon egg was incubated for fourteen months. The first three and a half months were within the mother's body. On average, between a quarter and a third survived to hatching.[8] White dragon eggs had to be buried in snow or encased in ice while incubating. The parents did not bother to tend or protect the eggs in any way, although they would usually lay them near their lairs. A newly hatched white wyrmling had scales as clear as ice, which became white as the dragon matured. They were expected to survive on their own from the moment they hatched, although some white dragon parents would permit their young to live in their lair until they reached adulthood.[citation needed] The wyrmling developed into a young dragon after about three or four years, and then into an adult after about 100 years. Elder white dragons aged from about 750 years, while ancients aged from 1700 years, and the oldest white dragons lived around 2100 years.[8] A depiction of a white dragon from Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.

        "description": "   Wights appeared as weird and twisted reflections of the forms they had in life.[3] They existed in a state between being alive and being dead. When attacking their prey, wights' eyes glowed like white-hot embers.[1] Their mummified flesh covered the twisted skeleton, the hands ended up in deadly claws,[4] and teeth were sharp and jagged like needles.[3] Most wights were humanoid.[8] Wights were evil undead creatures brought back to unlife by their vanity, evil deeds, and desires. Upon the ends of their mortal lives, the dying spirits reached out to Orcus or another evil deity, receiving undeath in exchange for spending eternity, hating and trying to destroy all living beings.[1] Wights retained their personalities and memories in the undeath. They possessed free will at the same time as they were tasked to perform the bidding of the evil powers that brought them back.[1] Even though wights hungered for living beings' energy, they did not require it as a source of sustenance. The wights could retain their undeath trapped in tombs for centuries. Their craving for life energy was more akin to an addiction. Sages theorized that when a wight drained a victim's life energy, it received a rush of mortality, euphoric reminder of their mortal existence. Chasing that feeling led to extremely depraved actions by wights.[9] Wights were territorial creatures. They rarely traveled away from their burial places, or locations they knew in life unless commanded by their masters. Some exceptions to the rules indeed existed. Scholars theorized that the wights' attachment to their tombs was due to its reminder of their condition, a source of pride, rather than sorrow. Another theory was they dwelled in catacombs simply due to the tactical benefits of winding corridors and shadows.[9] On contrary to wide belief, wights could be \"born\" anywhere, not necessarily in crypts and burial mounds. There were rumors of aquatic wights, returning to unlife among shipwrecks, possibly relating wights to lacedons.[10] A wight draining the life from its victim Upon touching someone living, wights drained the life out of the victim through flesh, clothing, and armor.[1] Wights were known to serve other stronger undead creatures like wraiths and other evil beings. When they followed a leader, they often avoided strategy and planning, relying on their drive for death and destruction instead.[1] A slaughter wight was able to release a death wail when slain. That ability whipped surrounding undead creatures into a frenzied attack.[2] Among scholars, at least, it was unheard of for wights to use weapons instead of their own claws.[11] Wights were active at night, retreating away from the hated sunlight into crypts, tombs, burial mounds, where they dwelt during the day. Unlike vampires though, wights simply disliked the sun, not harmed by it.[4] Their lairs were easily detected by eerie silence surrounding the area, abandoned by birds and wild animals, and abundant dead plant life.[1] Humanoid victims of the wights were returned as zombies controlled by their killer.[1] The creatures that were killed with the life-draining attacks came back as enslaved wights themselves. If the master was slain, the wights that were created regained their malicious free will. Bringing a wight back to life was nearly impossible.[4] A wight lurking in the darkness. Like other undead, wights did not need air, food, drink, or sleep. They were resistant to necrotic damage and to damage dealt by non-magical and non-silvered weapons, immune to poison[1], and paralyzation[4]. Wights were unaffected by sleep, charm, hold spells.[1][4] Holy water was deadly to these undead creatures, and raise dead spell could instantly annihilate a wight.[4] Due to their undead nature, wights existed simultaneously on the Prime Material as well as on the Negative Material planes, which granted them the powerful life-draining abilities that also nourished the creatures. A lot of animals could feel the presence of these evil dead creatures: dogs growled and howled, horses stopped and refused to move forward feeling the creatures, birds, and insects fell silent.[4] The word \"wight\" meant \"person\" in the Realms' past.[1] Centuries later, the word came to be exclusively used to describe these catacomb-dwelling undead creatures.[4] There was no known spell that could create a wight, and the legends that described their origins were contradictory.[12] The ancient barrow burial locations where wights could be often found could be found all over North-Western Faerun, namely the Moonshae Islands, Dalelands, and Rashemen. The Battle of Bones spawned a plethora of wights and undead over the years as well.[13] In 1357 DR wights could be found infesting the Burial Glen in Myth Drannor along with other undead creatures.[14] In 1371 DR a group of ten undead Purple Dragons wights roamed the High Road in Cormyr looking for the \u201cenemies of Cormyr\". In their twisted undead stare, of course, the enemies were all living beings.[15] The name \"wight\" is of Germanic origin. It began as a general word meaning \"being\" or \"creature\", but over the years it was increasingly applied to spirits of either good or evil until it was connotated with the supernatural.[18]",

        "description": "   The will-o'-wisp appeared to be nothing more than a hazy ball of light, colored white, blue, violet, green, or yellow, glowing as brightly as a flaming torch.[4][6] As such, it was easy to mistake one for a lantern, torch, or dancing lights.[6] Especially within the foggy marshes they tended to inhabit.[4] They tended to take on a blue, violet, or pale green hue whenever they were engaged in combat.[6] In fact, their faintly glowing bodies were just transparent balls of spongy matter, measuring 1\u202ffoot (30\u202fcentimeters) wide and weighing around 3\u202fpounds (1.4\u202fkilograms). Although they had no vocal organs, will-o'-wisps could vibrate to emit a ghostly sound, with which they could speak.[4] Boggarts were believed to be immature forms of will-o'-wisps. Unlike their mature counterparts, boggarts could take on a shape of small humanoids and lure their prey and a shape of a smaller but brighter wisp. Another major thing that differentiated will-o'-wisps and boggarts was that the immature forms needed to devour flesh and the life force of their prey.[7] These creatures could alter the brightness or dimness of their bodies' glow. This ability was used to confuse their prey.[6] A will-o'-wisp could even extinguish its glow, becoming for all intents and purposes invisible[4] to all except creatures who see invisible objects.[6] They typically did the latter whenever they were surprised or frightened.[4] Will-o'-wisps had total spell resistance, making them immune to most spells, apart from magic missile, maze[4] and protection from evil.[6] A will-o'-wisp could discharge electricity, inflicting small electric shocks on attackers.[4][6] Will-o'-wisp's luring someone to their sudden but inevitable doom. These creatures displayed exceptional levels of intelligence.[6] They reveled in luring travelers away from safe paths, bewildering them.[4] A will-o'-wisp would avoid combat if at all possible, but would attack with electric shocks if pressed.[4] Will-o'-wisps were typically found singly, in pairs, or in \"strings\" of three or four orbs.[4][6] These creatures subsisted upon the powerful emotions that are associated with fear, panic, and death.[4][6][note 1] They would often seek to lure creatures away from safe paths,[4] into perilous situations so they could feast upon their desperate emotions.[4][6] Will-o'-wisps were typically found in deserted, dangerous places where ones movement could get inhibited. Such as bogs, fens, swamps, as well as swampy dungeons and dungeons full of quicksand or pit-traps.[6] On Toril they were known to be inhabit the Vast Swamp, where they were often sighted from the Way of the Manticore.[8][9][10] As well as its counterpart in the Plane of Shadow, the Shadow Swamp.[11] They also harassed travelers in the Glaun Bog of Tasseldale.[12] Some will-o'-wisps served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and their appearance was seen by his followers as a sign of his favor.[13] Adventurers battling Shadowscale lizardfolk and will-o'-wisps in the Vast Swamp. In early Eleint of the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, a will-o'-wisp cooperated with the Sharran cultists at the Lost Refuge in the Vast Swamp. It posed as a torch outside the gatehouse and haunted the surrounding swampland, while helping to defend the base from intruders. It was presumably destroyed by adventurers in service to Mystra when they assault the base.[14] A squadron of will-o'-wisps once occupied Durlag's Tower in the Western Heartlands, but found themselves utilized as a part of the tower's own defenses.[15]",

They could breathe gusts of cold as well as bite their victims. They could also trip their enemies. They were immune to cold and cold magic, but were vulnerable to fire.[3][5] A winter wolf attacking a group of Northlanders. Winter wolves typically lived in packs of around three to five.[3] They were well organized and their leaders were both the strongest and smartest among them. When hunting they typically traveled against the wind in order to ensure that their prey couldn't smell them.[6] Like all wolves, these creatures were a carnivorous species.[3][5] Winter wolves were only known to inhabit cold climates,[3][5] particularly in forests and plains.[3] They inhabited the region of High Ice, where they often hunted ice toads.[6] In the Unapproachable East, winter wolves could be found in the the High Country[7] and coastal regions of Rashemen,[8][9] as well as Ashanath and Rawlinswood.[10] Beyond Faer\u00fbn, they could be found in nearly all arctic areas of Kara-Tur.[11] Beyond the Prime Material plane they could be found in the plane of Clangor, where they were used as mounts by the plane's goblin inhabitants, and the plane of Jotunheim where they were as large as elephants.[12] Winter Wolves were known to speak their own bestial language,[1][5] as well as the language of worgs,[5] Common, and Giant.[3] Winter wolves were sometimes found as allies and guardians of frost giants, white dragons, and other evil arctic beings.[3] The pelts of these creatures could often sell for around 5,000 gp.[5]",

        "description": "   Wraiths were very similar to specters.[citation needed] Wraiths became far weaker when under the exposure of full sunlight.[5] Like many undead, wraiths possessed a chilling touch. However, these beings were most similar in nature to the undead known as wights. Both could drain creatures of their life energy and could only be harmed by either silver or enchanted weaponry.[5] In 1479 DR,[8] wraiths, moon wraiths, and wisp wraiths could be found in the company of Shadovar.[9] Though they could be found on the Prime Material plane, wraiths were far more prominent in the Negative Energy plane. They were typically encountered in places that were dark and gloomy, away from the debilitating rays of the sun.[5] Beyond that, they could be found in the Domains of Dread.[12][13] Being a type of undead connected to Negative Energy plane, wraiths acted as servants of the deities Jergal,[14] Kiaransalee,[15] and the Chultan demigod Eshowdow.[16] Some were known to use the dust left behind by destroyed wraiths as a material component for the spell wraithform.[17] ",

They typically had either red or orange eyes[6][5] and their jaws were filled with long and sharp teeth.[6] Unlike true dragons, wyverns only had a pair of hind legs instead of a set four. Their wingspan could get over 50\u202ffeet (15\u202fmeters) in length.[6] And their tails were often quite long,[5] comprising almost half of their bodies,[6] yet very mobile.[5] These ended in a thick cartilage knot with a stinger protruding out of it, not unlike that of a scorpion.[6] Telltale sounds that these creatures produced included loud hisses and throated growls, similar to the vocalizations of alligators.[6] Wyverns were aggressive and not greatly intelligent.[6][5] They were not averse to attacking anything less powerful than themselves. Their sleek, strong legs proved very useful for an attack.[3][note 1] When fighting these creatures would dive down from above, grabbing prey with their hind leg claws, and then attempt to sting them to death. They were also known to slash at creatures with their claws mid-flight.[6] Their tails were so long that opponents were typically struck by a wyvern's tail before their legs.[5] Wyverns can be both solitary and group animals. They did not have a strong odor, although their lairs often could be tracked by following the smell of their recent kills.[6] Cloud giants kept griffons, perytons, and wyverns, akin to what humans did with hawks and other birds of prey. These tamed wild creatures could also be often encountered patrolling the cloud giants' gardens, together with other tamed predators like owlbears.[10] Dragons, griffons, and wyverns had a fierce rivalry over hippogriff meat. Manticores, chimeras, griffons, perytons, and wyverns were territorial rivals.[6] Despite their middling intelligence, wyverns were fluent speakers of Draconic.[6] These creatures were typically found in areas that were favored by dragons, such as tangled forests or large caverns.[5] Many were known to inhabit the Forest of Wyrms,[11] as well as the Cloak Wood forest.[12] On the Chultan Peninsula, wyverns were a common sight in the jungles of the nation of Samarach.[13] Wyverns were used as mounts by various races and cultures, including Zhentarim skymages[14] and the extradimensional marauder Imgig Zu.[15] The black dracolich Hethcypressarvil kept a pair of wyverns as pets at his lair in the nameless swamp of the Dragon Coast.[16] Wyvern hide was used in the creation of bookbindings,[17] and its blood was an ingredient in the belarris poison.[18] Additionally, the poisonous barbed tail of the beast was used in the creation of poison darts.[citation needed] The dried blood of a wyvern was one of the components used in create darkenbeast spells.[19] The meat of a wyvern's tail was said to be particularly delicious, having a taste and texture reminiscent of juicy pork. In Cormyr, a dish known as \"jack wyvern tail\" was a mixture of minced pork, rabbit, and turkey designed to mimic the flavor of real wyvern.[20] Wyverns were created by the aearee of Viakoo in \u221230,700 DR.[21] Some wyverns served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and their appearance was seen as a good sign by his followers.[22] House Dlardrageth, a powerful sun elf family from Arcorar that corrupted their bloodline by breeding with fiends, used the image of a golden wyvern against three red crossed swords as their house's insignia.[23] Expensive wyvern whiskey from Nimbral had a wyvern scale floating in every bottle.[24]  Linnorms: Corpse tearer \u2022 Dread \u2022 Stygian\nDrakes: Ambush \u2022 Black firedrake \u2022 Dragonne \u2022 Elemental (Earth \u2022 Fire \u2022 Ice \u2022 Magma \u2022 Ooze \u2022 Smoke \u2022 Water) \u2022 Felldrake (Crested \u2022 Spitting) \u2022 Greater \u2022 Guard \u2022 Mind \u2022 Portal \u2022 Rage \u2022 Space \u2022 Vulture ",

        "description": "   Xorns were very odd-looking creatures. They had radially symmetrical bodies with a large mouth at the top surrounded by three long arms interspersed with their three eyes. Their wide, pebbly, and rocky bodies rested upon three stumpy legs. They had talons at the end of their arms.[6][4] Smaller xorns were about 3\u202ffeet (0.91\u202fmeters) tall, but the oldest specimens could reach 8\u202ffeet (2.4\u202fmeters) in height and width and weighed as much as 9,000\u202fpounds (4,100\u202fkilograms).[6] Xorns were immune to the effects of fire and cold and were resistant to electricity.[6][4] A xaren (pronounced: /\u02c8z\u00e6r\u028cn/ Z\u00c6R-un[7]) was a variation of xorn with more metallic-like skin. They were slightly smaller than regular xorns, and their diet consisted of a greater proportion of metal, especially enchanted metals, from which they drew strength.[4] Like many creatures from the Plane of Earth, xorns could travel through ground and stone as if it were water, leaving behind no tunnel at all.[6] They always passed through the ground mouth-first.[6] Xorns could sense the vibrations of other creatures in the earth[6] and they could smell their food from 20\u202ffeet (6.1\u202fmeters) away.[6][4] A xaren could smell magical metal from twice that distance.[4] They could speak Common and Terran.[6] Adventurers followed by xorns in the Plane of Earth. Xorns were scavengers, and they consumed rocks, minerals, and gems. In fact, they could not digest meat at all, so they did not eat creatures on the Prime Material Plane. They only attacked to defend themselves, although they could be more aggressive if hungry and hunting for their inorganic food. If in groups, they would often send one of their number to negotiate for food.[6][4] It was extremely likely that they would attack if their requests for food were not granted.[4] If they did resort to fighting, they often hid below the surface and erupted at their enemies, attacking with bites and talons.[6] On the surface, they could swing their arms at all enemies around them. If they were focused on a single foe, they would rear up on two of their three feet so that they could attack with their bite in addition to their arms.[4] If injured, a xorn would usually resort to guerrilla tactics, constantly merging into the ground for safety and then erupting again to resume attack.[4] A xorn greedily consuming a chest full of treasure in front of a dwarf miner. On the Plane of Earth, where their food was plentiful, the xorns were peaceful creatures, living in nomadic clans. Xorns and xarens rarely cooperated.[4] Grumbar, the lord of elemental earth, naturally favored xorns. They were sacred to the gnome deities Callarduran Smoothhands and Flandal Steelskin and the Mulhorandi god Geb as well. These powers would sometimes send xorns to aid their followers.[8] The dao would often hunt xorn for sport or keep them as slaves.[4] Xorn maintained good relations with the yak folk found on the planes.[9] The stony flesh of xorns was a required component in the creation of daggers of defiance.[10] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",

A black dragon grew up to a maximum size of 16\u202ffeet (4.9\u202fmeters) tall, 85\u202ffeet (26\u202fmeters) in length, with a wingspan of 80\u202ffeet (24\u202fmeters). They weighed up to 160,000\u202fpounds (73,000\u202fkilograms).[11] Solitary and extremely territorial in their nature, black dragons would seldom form clans, opting to do so only when they lived in the most hazardous of environments or when faced with a danger that could wipe out large swaths of their population.[9] Black dragons preferred ambushes to straightforward fighting.[8] A review of black dragon anatomy. Black dragons breathed a stream of acid.[5][4] Black dragons lived in swamps, jungles and fetid marshlands.[10] They were cunning creatures who lived to inspire fear and rule by intimidation. The black, glossy scales of black dragons added to their camouflage within swamp lands. They preferred to ambush their targets, using darkness or water as their cover. They were excellent swimmers and often made their lairs in submerged caves or underground chambers near swamps or murky ponds. Their lairs always had two entrances: one underwater through the adjacent swamp or pond, and one above-ground, disguised amidst the undergrowth.[12] Female dragons took the lead when it came to breeding, choosing their mate largely based on the size of the hoard of prospective males. Because of this, male black dragons would often brag about their accumulated wealth to communicative creatures or others of their own kind, in the hopes that rumors of their hoard would spread to any females in the area that were looking to mate. When two or more females selected the same male as their partner, they would fight for dominance high in the air above the lair of the male, allowing him to gaze upon his future mate's victory in admiration.[9] Black dragons were not noted as good parents, relying more upon disguise and hiding to protect their eggs than upon guarding them personally. Black dragon eggs must be submerged in strong acid while growing, which helped protect the dragon as well.[13] Black dragons would only protect their young so long as that responsibility didn't threaten their own life. If they had to choose between saving their own life or those of their clutch or spawn, they would most certainly choose the former; though they would assuredly seek revenge afterwards.[9] Black dragon wyrmling. A black dragon's diet consisted of fish, mollusks, aquatic critters and some red meat from terrestrial animals.[12] The skies over the southwestern Bay of Chessenta and southern Chondalwood have been the source of multiple sightings of black dragons. Reports from the jungles of Chult of dense, multi-layered tropical forest complete with its own ecosystem, were highlighted with tales of black dragons living within the canopy.[10] The iconography of the Purple Dragon Knights of Cormyr stemmed from the legend of the great black dragon Thauglor, who once dominated the area upon which the kingdom was built.[14] Black dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and were seen as good omens by his followers.[15] A black dragon demonstrating its acid breath.

        "description": "   A review of blue dragon anatomy. Blue dragons were physically distinguished by the single large horn protruding from their heads and also by their ears, which were rather large and frilled. The neck is short and broad, with spines growing from it. The tail is thick and bumpy, like that of a crocodile. The wings are more pronounced than most other species'. They smelled like electricity or sand. The blue dragon excelled at aerial combat, perhaps more so than any other species of dragon. Their lightning discharges were very easy to aim at other aerial foes, or at creatures below them on the ground. They were also extremely adept at burrowing in sand, and often lie in wait just below the surface of the desert for prey. When they were so burrowed, their large horns could easily be mistaken for pointed desert rocks. Blue dragons used a shocking burst of lightning. Blue dragons were native to arid wastelands and deserts. They made their lairs in underground caves; easily accessible to the dragons, as they could burrow through the ground. These dragons would fly above their territory, using the bleak landscape and its sparse terrain features as their best chance of spotting opponents. The typical blue dragon lair was dug into one of the towering rock formations that dominate desert landscapes. As with all dragon lairs, the blue dragon's lair would have two entrances: one at ground level and hidden by the sand, and one opening onto a high ledge on which it could perch and survey its territory. Each lair also had a large subterranean cavern with a large pool of water and a sandy beach, which its inhabitant would use for drinking and relaxation. Despite their evil nature, blue dragons were actually excellent parents to their young, and would rarely leave their eggs unattended. Blue dragon eggs must be buried in warm sand to incubate. Blue wyrmlings were actually quite cute, but they were quick to taunt any other creature, and even quicker to hunt small desert creatures for food.

        "description": "   A review of brass dragon anatomy. Physically, the brass dragon was highly distinctive. From below, its outstretched wings formed a triangular shape, as they were attached to its body all the way to the tip of its tail. The wings were longest at the shoulder, and tapered gently as they reached the tail. Their scales seemed to radiate heat and light. As their name implied, brass dragons tended to have brass-colored scales. Their scales were a dull brown at a young age, becoming more glossy and brass-like in appearance as they aged. The shape of the head was quite unusual, as it included a large, curved plate that extended from the dragon's eyes and cheeks on either side and curved upwards into two points. They had two sharp horns on the chin, which became steadily pointier as the dragon aged. They smelled like metal.[6] Brass dragons very rarely engaged in combat, preferring to talk rather than fight. If they considered a creature threatening, they would subdue it with their sleeping gas. In the face of true danger, a younger brass dragon would have most likely flown away and hidden in the sand. It would have fought and used its fire breath only as an absolute last resort. Older brass dragons preferred to avoid combat but would fight if they had the tactical advantage[7] Brass dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a narrow line of fire, and the second was a cone of sleep gas.[5] Brass dragons hunted their prey while flying, mainly consuming antelope, mountain goats and sheep. Only evil brass dragons hunted intelligent creatures. Brass dragons have evolved for living in the desert and therefore can go long periods without water.[8] A stuffed young brass dragon was kept in the Obstacle Course level of Undermountain.[9] Brass dragons were native to arid regions; they shared many similar habitats with blue dragons, which often led to conflict. The brass dragon preferred to dig its lair inside a desert peak or spire. They also preferred to have the bulk of their lairs face eastwards, so that the rising sun would warm the lair for the bulk of the day. A brass dragon's lair was well-constructed and quite extensive, with many twisting corridors and dead ends to confuse and discourage hostile intruders.[6] The centerpiece of any brass dragon's lair was the Grand Conversation Hall, where it spent the majority of its time entertaining friends and visitors. A typical lair also contained an elegant foyer, a gallery for the artwork the dragon collected, a sleeping chamber, and a storage room. All brass dragon lairs had several small entrances, known as bolt holes. These multiple entrances allowed a brass dragon to easily escape an attack by a blue dragon or other predator.[citation needed] Brass dragon eggs were incubated in a nest of open flames. Incubation took approximately 480 days.[10] The eggs were typically tended by both parents, so that they could talk together as they maintained their vigil. The newly hatched brass wyrmling was not remarkable in appearance; its scales were a dull brown. The scales became lighter and more brilliant as the dragon matured. Brass wyrmlings probably learned to talk more quickly than the young of any other sapient species. They talked constantly about anything and everything, and they would talk to anybody: friends, family, enemies and small creatures that could not talk back, or even to itself if nobody else was near. When exposed to a new language, a brass wyrmling would usually become fluent in under an hour.[citation needed] Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap  ",

        "description": "   A review of bronze dragon anatomy. Physically, the bronze dragon was quite fierce in appearance, despite its good nature. While most of its body was a reflective bronze color, the wings were often tipped with green. The dragon had four large horns on each side of their heads, three protruding from each cheek and one from the top of their head, pointing back towards the tail. The tips of these points were black and very sharp, and were often used for grooming. The tongue was purple-gray, long and pointed, and not forked. A large frill ran down the upper part of its neck.[citation needed] Bronze dragons smelled like sea spray.[6] These dragons possessed the ability to alter their form, assuming the appearance of any type of animal or humanoid creature they choose. As such, many could have encountered a bronze dragon without ever being the wiser. A friendly dolphin that saved a drowning child; a mercenary sailor eager to fight pirates; a diver specializing in searching undersea shipwrecks for possible treasure\u2026 all of these could have been a bronze dragon. Many bronze dragons would use their shape-shifting abilities to get close to an enemy target; bronze dragons prefer melee combat.[citation needed] Bronze dragons could speak with animals, create food and water, make fog, control water and weather, and detect thought.[citation needed] While bronze dragons were often fascinated with battles, especially fighting to defeat evil, they had strong moral compunctions against killing living beings unless absolutely necessary. They would often join good-aligned armies to fight the forces of evil, either in human form or their own. In battle, their weapon of choice was to breathe repulsion gas, which is so putrid that it forced absolutely everything away. They also liked to relocate a foe to a remote location where it could do no harm when possible. When absolutely forced to kill, the bronze dragon was a deadly combatant, roasting enemies with bursts of lightning or ripping them open with its clawed forelegs.[citation needed] Bronze dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of electricity similar to a lightning bolt, and the second was either a cone of gas that affected the minds of creatures caught in it, causing them to flee for a short time,[7] or a cone of repulsion energy which physically pushed enemies away.[1] They truly enjoyed observing and interacting with smaller creatures, most especially humans. They often went out of their way to help them, such as rescuing humans from a shipwreck or a dangerous foe. In many of these instances, the bronze dragon would transform itself into a human, so that those who it helped never knew who really did the rescuing. They would never seek payment for their help, in any form. They always sought justice as best they could, and could not abide to see any creature being treated with cruelty of any sort. The older the dragon, the more pronounced the passion for justice became. They were probably the most social species of dragon, and often swam and played together in groups. They also loved to attend human festivals and parties, although usually in human form. The bronze dragons were spiritually connected to silver dragons as they have similar personalities and were each involved in an ancient ritual.[citation needed] Bronze dragons were often found along the coastal regions of the world. They liked to dwell along the sea, to make use of their aquatic abilities, while staying close to humanoid settlements. Many ship merchants would pay a bronze dragon to protect their trade routes. More nefarious bronze dragons would demand bribes for \u201cprotection\u201d while accepting similar bribes from pirates to operate within their territories. Given its exceptional abilities as a swimmer, the entrance to a bronze dragon's lair was quite naturally underwater, and was often disguised with seaweed and coral. The bulk of the lair was above water level, however, consisting of multiple tunnels and large chambers, some as much as a thousand feet above sea level. They preferred to make their lairs in an island volcano, if possible.[citation needed] A bronze dragon wyrmling Bronze dragons mated for life, and took their duties as parents with the utmost seriousness. They protected their eggs and their wyrmlings at any cost. Although bronze dragons always lived near water, they laid their eggs in a dry cave. Apart from a dry, relatively warm environment, bronze dragon eggs required no special conditions for incubation like those of most dragons. Upon hatching, the wyrmlings were raised, taught, and protected by their parents. A newly-hatched bronze wyrmling appeared yellow with a tinge of green, and the scales gradually shifted to bronze as it matured. Bronze wyrmlings loved to swim in the ocean, and frolic in much the same manner as dolphins.[citation needed] Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap  ",

        "description": "   Copper dragons had short faces, with features that included cheek ridges that pointed backwards, as well as frills on the back of their lower jaws. Their long segmented horns started as smooth brow plates above their eyes that extended backwards. From their chins, layers of triangular blades grew downward, growing more numerous as they aged. Combined together, those features gave copper dragons a pensive look. As they aged, their pupils faded away until their eyes acquired an appearance of glowing turquoise.[1][7] Their wings were manta-like, mottled with red and green discolorations near the end. They were supported at the front by relatively short articulated alar limbs that gave them a characteristic U shape when viewed from below, as well as spines that ran the wings' length to the back, at an angle from the backbone.[7] Newly hatched copper dragons had brown scales with a metallic tint, which grew coppery and glossy in color as the dragon aged. The scales of very old copper dragons acquired a green shade.[1][7] Copper dragons gave off a stony scent.[7] When it came to open battle, copper dragons were formidable fighters.[8] Copper dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a line of powerful acid, and the second was a cone of gas that slowed anyone within it.[3] A review of copper dragon anatomy. Copper dragons were usually even-tempered and sociable. They were well known for playing pranks and telling jokes and riddles. They enjoyed a good joke, riddle, funny story, or any form of good humor or wit, but became annoyed if someone didn't laugh at a joke that they made or take their pranks well. These habits made them especially fond of bards, and they appreciated their company enough that they were sometimes willing to set aside a temporary separate space for them in their lairs so they might provide entertainment.[1] However, they could also be greedy, envious, and stingy, and particularly dangerous when their treasure hoards were at threat. Nevertheless, good companionship was just as much a treasure to them.[1] A copper dragon's lair was usually found in rocky, dry uplands and hilltops, created inside narrow caverns within them. False walls could be created by the dragon in the lair to hide secret chambers and their most treasured items. Other things that were worthless to the copper dragon were placed away from the main hoard in order to tease treasure-seekers. In their main hoard, copper dragons kept precious ores, artworks, and curios that they had accumulated over their long lifetimes.[1] Copper dragons were often found in the service of the deities Brandobaris, Erevan Ilesere, and Vergadain.[9] Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap  ",

        "description": " This is a\nGood Article!   A review of gold dragon anatomy. A gold dragon's head was characterized by a short face with long and smooth metallic horns that swept back from its nose and brow, as well as the neck frills that adorned both sides of its neck. From the mouth and nostrils descended four pairs of long, flexible muscular spines that resembled whiskers or barbels. Along with the dragon's narrow eyes, these features contributed to give them a look of sagacity. As the dragon aged, its pupils faded away until the eyes acquired an appearance of shiny, liquid gold. Other facial features included a pointed tongue and small cheek horns that grew sideways.[1][9][10] Gold dragons had broad sail-like wings[note 1] that started from their shoulders and extended all the way to the end of their extremely long tails. During flight, the wings moved in a graceful rippling motion that resembled swimming. This elegant flying motion was considered by many scholars, as well as by the gold dragons themselves, to be the most graceful among true dragons. When on the ground, the wings were kept closed upright over its back if the dragon was at rest, or folded facing back if the dragon was walking or running.[1][9] A newly hatched gold dragon had dark yellow scales dotted with metallic specks that increased in size with age, until they totally covered the scales, giving a shiny and radiant golden color to the adult dragon's entire body.[1][9][10] Despite being capable of eating almost anything, gold dragons tended to hunt large and dangerous monsters[10] and were particularly fond of including pearls and gems in their diet. Older dragons even had the ability to supernaturally locate gems in their vicinity. They tended to receive such gifts well, except if they were given as bribes.[1][4] Gold dragons could breathe underwater.[1][4] They gave off scents of saffron and incense,[9] and sometimes a faint smell of molten metal.[10] A gold dragon teaching a human. It was common for gold dragons to appoint themselves with quests to promote good. Those that earned a gold dragon's fury found a relentless enemy who would not rest until the utter and complete subjugation of the evildoers. Either by slaying or by bringing villains to justice, a gold dragon's only acceptable outcome was complete victory over evil.[9] When looking for a lair, gold dragons usually sought secluded and remote locations. They had a preference for idyllic or picturesque locations, such as rivers or the bottom of lakes, cave complexes, ancient ruins, deep gorges, high plateaus, or mist-covered islands.[1][9] They also had a preference for rolling hills, open plains, and in some rare cases even within humanoid communities which they have chosen to protect.[10] They were very private creatures, mostly keeping to themselves and their families and rarely fraternizing with other dragons.[1] Older gold dragons were capable of shapeshifting into humanoid or beast forms. They usually spent most of the time in this form, even within their lairs. When traveling, it was common for a gold dragon to assume a particularly non-threatening form in order to put adventurers at ease, as well as to observe local communities and to catch up on gossip and news of the outside world. In many cases, the dragon would use its disguise to provide help, company and comfort to those in need, or to set up traps for evildoers by using itself as bait.[1][9] Strong believers in the greater good and in the rule of order, gold dragons were sometimes viewed as arrogant and dismissive. They tended to avoid philosophical or ethical discussions with beings they deemed inferior, although they enjoyed arguing in favor of law.[9] Due to their vast superiority with respect to the average humanoid, they often had difficulty in understanding the everyday troubles and needs of communities and in some rare instances might even end up becoming tyrants.[10] The gold dragon Aurinax guarding the Vault of Dragons in Waterdeep. Gold dragons preferred to parlay before a fight, using their intimidating presence and insight to determine if fighting was necessary, to find advantages, and to buy time to cast preparatory spells.[4][9] If fighting became necessary, they made heavy use of fire-based spells such as delayed blast fireball and fire shield, as well as deterrent spells such as cloudkill, globe of invulnerability, maze, sleep, slow, and stinking cloud.[4] A common tactic for gold dragons in a fight was to use their breath weapons as means to scatter and weaken their foes.[3] They possessed two such breath weapons: a powerful fire breath and a cone of weakening gas.[1][4] Every gold dragon in the world acknowledged a hierarchy which spanned the entire race. This structure had a single elected leader at the top: a wyrm or great wyrm called the King (or Queen) of Justice who bore the honorific \"Your Resplendence\" and served until death or resignation. The selection of a replacement (either by election or, more frequently, by acclamation) was a process in which all gold dragons took part. It was also possible for two dragons of equal merit to be elected as leaders, in which case they could share duties or alternate leadership.[9][11] Because gold dragons were well aware of their responsibilities, the duties of the King of Justice were typically light. They would most frequently act as advisors to other dragons and their quests to defeat evil, pointing out consequences and hidden ramifications. Less frequently, the gold dragon ruler acted as a representative of the entire race when dealing with other species, or as a judge in the extremely rare occasion in which a gold dragon committed an offense.[9][11] Gold dragons did not have strong preferences about their lairs, but they tended to choose lairs made of stone, such as caves and castles, and recruited other loyal creatures as guards.[3][4] An angry gold dragon defending its treasure. The lair of a gold dragon possessed some residual magic. While in its lair, a gold dragon had a limited capability to glimpse into the future and to banish invaders into a dream plane of the dragon's own creation. The region around the lair also experienced some magical effects, such as banks of opalescent mists that haunted evil creatures and warned good creatures of danger. The dragon also was capable of establishing a telepathic contact with sleeping creatures within 6\u202fmiles (9.7\u202fkilometers) of its lair. Within 1\u202fmile (1.6\u202fkilometers) of the lair, gems and pearls shone and emitted a faint light.[1] Gold dragons enjoyed treasure that showed artisanship, such as paintings, sculptures, calligraphy and porcelain.[9] They had a great fascination for magic items and loved to add them to their hoards.[11] It was common for them to magically ward their hoards so that it was impossible for an item to be removed without the dragon's knowledge.[1] Gold dragons were known to reside in the Serpent Hills, the Earthfast Mountains, the Vast, the Graypeak Mountains, Loudwater, the Orsraun Mountains and Turmish.[12] When choosing a mate, gold dragons could spend years debating philosophy and ethics and questing together as part of their courtship. Prospective mates then sought approval from the King of Justice. Some gold dragons mated for life through a rite known as the Oath of Concord, while others only mated for a short time. They could be monogamous or hold several mates at the same time.[9][11] Gold dragons raised their young with exceptional care. A gold dragon wyrmling did not have whiskers, but they developed quickly. It was also common for gold dragon parents to send their young to the care of foster parents. This could serve a variety of reasons, such as freeing the parents for a quest, or just broadening their horizons.[9] Wyrmling, very young, young, juvenile, and young adult gold dragons tended to be solitary or lived in a clutch of 2 to 5 dragons; adults, mature adults, older dragons, wyrms or great wyrms would live solitarily, in a pair, or a family consisting of a couple of adults and several offspring.[4] Gold dragons were the only species of dragon to have their own written language. However, they could only write in human form, since their dragon claws were not practical for holding writing equipment.[13] These dragons even kept records of historic events. The content of these records was mostly useless to human historians however, as they described dragon events like dragon births, trials and deaths, rather than events that affected the non-dragon world.[11] Protanther leading the council of metallic dragons in the Nether Mountains. During the glory days of Myth Drannor, before its destruction in the Weeping War, gold dragons were one of the races that dwelled in the City of Song in harmony. At one point before the city's fall, the gold dragons of Myth Drannor aided in magically trapping a powerful demon Rivener who became too powerful to defeat after he stole one of the Baneblades of Demron.[14] Sometime before 1357 DR, Protanther was King of Justice for western Faer\u00fbn until he resigned in favor of Lareth,[11] who kept the title until his death in the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR.[15] He was succeeded by Tamarand, who still held the title as of 1479 DR.[16] Sometime in the late 1480s DR Protanther represented the gold dragons by gathering a council of metallic dragons in the battle against the reformed Cult of the Dragon's efforts to summon Tiamat.[17] Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap  ",

        "description": "   Green dragons were most notable for the large, waving crest or fin that started at the dragon's nose and ran the entire length of the dragon's body. They also had exceptionally long, slender forked tongues.[citation needed] A review of green dragon anatomy. These dragons were known to have very bad tempers and a tendency for evil behavior.[6] They loved intrigue and secrets. They put up a front of diplomacy and deceit when dealing with stronger foes, but they revealed their cruel and petty nature when intimidating lesser beings or when gaining the upper hand. They delighted in stalking their enemies and listening in for any information they could gather before moving to attack. Green dragons especially enjoyed corrupting or consuming elves and fey creatures.[citation needed] Beyond fighting with their massive jaws and claws, these dragons were capable of expelling a cone of poisonous chlorine gas.[6] Green dragons sometimes served the dark Chultan demigod Eshowdow, and their appearance was considered a good omen by his followers.[7] Green dragons valued their territory, but only as a means to gain as much power as possible without expending considerable effort. They would sometimes trade safe passage for a worthy item to add to their hoards. Even so, they were extremely cunning and duplicitous foes, and loved double-crossing others. A traveler who stumbled into a green dragon's territory might be able to bribe the dragon for safe passage, but more often than not the dragon would pretend to agree and then attack the unsuspecting offender once their guard was down. Worse, if the traveler impressed the green dragon during its stay, they might start thinking of the newcomer as a prized possession to be corrupted and sculpted to its will.[citation needed] The typical green dragon lair was located underground[6] and was a complex of caves and tunnels, with its main entrance hidden behind a waterfall. The preferred green dragon lair was a cave high up on a cliff, but such locations were usually hard to find and thus only home to the oldest and most powerful green dragons.[citation needed] These dragons were typically found to live near woodlands.[6] A green dragon wyrmling. Green dragons were reasonably good parents, with both mother and father typically staying close to their eggs while they were incubating. Green dragon females either kept their eggs in a solution of acid or buried them in leaves moistened with rainwater. The green wyrmling was easily mistaken for a black, due to their nearly black scales. As the wyrmling matured, its scales became steadily lighter in color until they reached the striking green shade of an adult. The wyrmlings typically stayed with both parents until they reached adulthood (approximately 100 years).[citation needed] One of the ways of creating a wand of stinking cloud was using a horn of an old green dragon.[8] Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap  ",

        "description": "   The largest and most powerful of the chromatic dragons, red dragons were also the most fearsome and cruel. These dragons delighted in ruin, death and destruction.[8] They breathed a cone of fire.[4] Red dragons were physically distinguished by their enormous size and wingspan. They had two large horns upon their heads, which pointed backwards toward their wings. They smelled of smoke and sulfur.[10] Like all chromatic dragons, reds lived their lives in cycles of activity and hibernation. While these cyclical rhythms weren't as extreme as green dragons, red dragons sealed themselves within their lairs for upwards of ten years at a time.[11] During their active periods they were known as voracious over-hunters, whose hunger ensured that the populations of any nearby creatures did not grow beyond ecological stability.[12] A red dragon with a humanoid in its grasp Red Dragons believed that they were the pinnacle of draconic nature and that all other species were impure. They valued vengefulness, rapaciousness, avarice, and ferocity above other traits and recognized these traits in themselves with pride. They were solitary creatures and cared little for news of other types of dragons. However, they did look for news of other red dragons in their area.[8] If they believed their own achievements and possessions to be greater than these other red dragons then they stayed in their caves, smugly congratulating themselves. However, if they learned that the achievements or possessions of the other red dragons were greater than their own they would fly into a vengeful rage, decimating the surrounding area until they believed that they had outdone their rivals. The dragon became much less cautious during this time and much more likely to underestimate their foes.[8] A red dragon would go to extreme lengths to ensure that they were superior to every other red dragon in the area. They would often burn down only half a village or let a single adventurer flee from a battle so that word of their power spread throughout the region. Not only would this anger other red dragons but it was also like a shining beacon to adventurers and treasure hunters.[8][10] Red dragons despised weakness among their own kind. If one ever found out that another of their kin demonstrated any signs of fragility, either by getting badly wounded or if they were becoming senile in old age, then local red dragons would descend on the lair, stripping it clean and usually killing the owner. They believed that if a red dragon could not protect what it had, then it did not deserve it to begin with.[13] Reds were also highly territorial. Entering an area a red considered its domain was just asking to be attacked, especially if it was another dragon entering the area (even more so if it was a red dragon). Conflict was inevitable if this were the case and it was almost always to the death as neither would dare show weakness to the other. Thankfully, most other species were smart enough to flee if they realized the area belonged to a red dragon. Red dragons could get so territorial that in rare occasions they would adopt a protective yet patronizing attitude towards creatures they considered inferior that lived within their self-imposed borders.[8] Red dragons hated any authority other than their own. They never asked elders for advice, even if doing so would save their lives as to them, admitting they needed something their elders had was the same as putting themselves under their authority.[citation needed] A red dragon incinerating a pesky adventurer. Red dragons expelled an extremely devastating cone of fire.[1] Adventurers which were either banded together too tightly or lacked fire protection would likely find themselves burned to a crisp before they could even begin to battle the mighty enemy. Red dragons prefer to fight with their physical bite and claws, but they might barbecue obviously powerful or numerous foes before bloodletting with glee. The dragons would also prefer not to use their breath on particularly weak enemies so as to not destroy the valuable treasure they carry.  A review of red dragon anatomy. Red dragons made their homes in mountainous lairs particularly throughout the peaks of northwestern and northern Faer\u00fbn, surrounding the great desert of Anauroch.[14] They were particularly abundant around the snow-capped mountains of the Spine of the World.[15] Some red dragons have been spotted as far south as the Sunset Mountains, or even Tethyr,[16] though they generally avoided any rangers near \"civilized\" lands.[14] Red dragons loved to make their lairs in deep, underground caves in mountainous regions. Many preferred to dwell in volcanoes, where the intense heat kept others at bay. Almost all red dragons simply required a high perch. The higher the better as they believed that their domain encompassed all that they could see.[10] Young red dragons, especially wyrmlings were easy prey for predators and hunters due to their bright, glossy scarlet scales, so they tended to stay underground in the darkness until they felt that they could defend themselves properly.[10] Many red dragons were known to worship the deities Bane, Garyx, Loviatar, and Malar.[17] Mating was initiated by the female every century or so when she felt the urge to have children. She looked for the nearest red dragon with the most wealth and power. As such, males never denied their advances. It was a sign of prestige among other males to be requested to mate.[13] After mating, the male then abandoned her while she hatched her eggs. She jealously guarded the clutch, occasionally with the assistance of an infertile female, but rarely laid down her own life for her hatchlings.[13] An average red dragon clutch had four eggs and had an incubation time of 270 days.[10] A red dragon notices the last survivor of a burning town. Once her young reached the young adult stage of development, or sometimes earlier, the mother's natural instincts overruled her maternal ones and she forced all of her young from her territory.[13] Red dragons hated silver dragons with a passion as their familiarity with the element of cold and other natural powers often made red dragons appear weak in battle with them. They also commonly came into conflict with copper dragons for territory rights, though copper dragons rarely won out against the more powerful red dragons in open conflict.[8] Above all though, red dragons hated gold dragons. Red dragons might loudly proclaim that they would fight and defeat any gold dragon they came across but often found an excuse not to fight when that time eventually came. Gold dragons were so similar to red dragons yet their natural moral differences were extreme.[8] A small contingent of red dragons served high-ranking githyanki as mounts and companions, following a treaty established with Tiamat during the war between the gith and the mind flayers. The dragons served the githyanki during their young age, being dismissed as soon as they reached adulthood and keeping the wealth accumulated over their years of service.[18] The dragons resented their time of servitude, but were eager to participate in raids thanks to the promise of treasure and of growing in power. The dragons remained loyal to their riders as long as they were treated respectfully and were given ample opportunities to pillage.[18] It was said the flesh of red dragons tasted extremely spicy. To be properly prepared, it had to be exposed to open air for at least two days and aged for some time. Anyone who ate red dragon meat that was not treated in this manner was susceptible to horrible cramps and extreme pain.[19] In addition, the bones and scales of all dragons can be used to craft powerful magical equipment with the correct know-how (for example, dragon scale mail). The equipment would usually be imbued with the elemental powers of the dragon it came from, so in the case of red dragons, such equipment would either protect from or deal fire damage. \"Visiting\" a red dragon's lair could be a reckless endeavor.

        "description": "   A silver dragon enjoyed the company of humans and elves so much that it would often take the form of a human or elf and live among them for the majority of its life. However, it should be noted that silvers, like all dragons, believed themselves the most superior creatures in the world. However, apart from the ability to fly, which they enjoyed greatly, they tended to prefer the physical forms of humanoids for everyday life.[9] An overview of silver dragon anatomy. The silver dragon was regal and statuesque.[4] At first glance, a silver dragon appeared very similar to a white dragon. The wings were more curved than a white's, however, and a silver had two talons on its wings rather than the single talon of most dragons. The silver dragon also had a beautiful frill that began at the top of its head and flowed all the way down its neck and body to the tip of its tail. The frill was silver towards the body, fading to a purple hue at the edge. They had two long, smooth silver horns with black tips, pointing up and back from the head. They also had a pronounced sharp frill under the chin, which had the rough appearance of a goatee. They smelled like rain.[9] They were very intelligent, more so than most humans, extremely powerful, breathtakingly beautiful, and had lifespans that could reach 4,200 years.[7] Unlike the gold and bronze dragons, the silver dragon did not usually go out of its way to bring justice to the world. Instead, it waited for others to ask them for help; They would attempt to right an injustice if they saw one, but they had no inclination to intentionally seek evil out and destroy it. Silver dragons were more interested in protecting the humans or elves that came to its care.[9] One unusual trait they had was the love of human dining;[4][9] moreover, they would use their alternate form ability to take part in large feasts. Like most metallic dragons, silvers did not enjoy combat, and were averse to killing. If forced to fight, however, they were as deadly as any other dragon.[9] Silver dragons had two separate breath weapons. The first was a cone of freezing cold, similar to that of white dragons. The second was a cone of paralyzing gas.[4] Silver dragons were extremely rare and elusive, preferring to take the guise of kind and elderly humanoids or very attractive and young humanoids. They very much liked to associate with elves and humans, not necessarily because they preferred their company over other races, but because they tried to learn from the shorter-lived humans.[9] Most silvers grouped together in \"clans\", a loose organization of dragons who chose to live together as a family. Clans took communal responsibility for protecting and raising their wyrmlings. A senior member of the clan might act as a leader, but no true leader actually existed. Silver dragons did not feel the need for a strict social structure, since they were most content to live as honestly as possible.[9] Silver dragons' favored enemy were red dragons because these chromatic dragons were almost always evil and had a talent for destruction. Additionally, silvers and reds favored the same sort of terrain for lairs, which led to territorial disputes on top of having attitudes and philosophies at odds with the others.[9] Dragons could live for millennia, while humans only lived a few decades. This vast difference in time led to inherent psychological differences concerning time. Dragons tended to think things through for years at a time, using their razor-sharp intellects to hone a plan to perfection, solve incalculable puzzles, or other such things. Silver dragons, however, noted that humans were able to accomplish much in their short lifespans because of their ambitious drive for success. When a silver dragon could combine its own long-term perspective with a quick and ambitious attitude, the benefit was undeniable.[9] Some silver dragons served certain deities as servants, including Aerdrie Faenya, Arvoreen, Corellon, Eilistraee, Gaerdal Ironhand, Gorm Gulthyn, Labelas Enoreth, Moradin, Sehanine Moonbow, Torm, and Yondalla.[10] A silver dragon's lair was typically found within an icy mountain, with the main entrance only accessible by air. The lair itself was similar to the gold dragon's in its sophistication and design, although the silver dragon's lair tended to be far less intricate. A typical lair would contain a main entertaining area, a storage room, a vault, a sleeping chamber, study, library, shrine, and two clinic rooms where the dragon could offer help and protection to those who needed it. The lair would also have a concealed back entrance for use in emergencies.[citation needed] Silver dragons laid their eggs in a bed of snow.[citation needed] A newly hatched silver wyrmling had scales of a bluish gray, which changed to silver over time.[5] Silver wyrmlings were intelligent, kind, extremely curious, and adorable.[citation needed] As they matured, many silver dragons left their clans for long periods of time to live among nondragons. They tended to live for many years with the same group of humans or elves, having grown attached to them. As members of the family died, the silver dragon, grieved by the loss, often chose to stay with the family, remaining a true and loyal friend and champion through many generations. If the dragon felt comfortable enough around these nondragons, it might even decide to reveal its true self.[citation needed] Not actually a silver dragon in any case. During the Time of Troubles of the Year of Shadows, 1358 DR, a brainwashed Luna used shapechange to turn into a silver dragon and attacked her friends Vajra Valmeyjar, Kyriani Agrivar, Onyx the Invincible, and Timoth Eyesbright outside the House of the Moon. However, the spell did not last long, and she quickly reverted to human form.[11][note 2] Chromatic dragons: Red \u2022 Black \u2022 Blue \u2022 Green \u2022 White \u2022 Brown \u2022 Gray \u2022 Purple \u2022 Pink \u2022 Salt \u2022 Yellow\nGem dragons: Amethyst \u2022 Beljuril \u2022 Emerald \u2022 Sapphire \u2022 Topaz \u2022 Crystal \u2022 Obsidian \u2022 Ruby\nNeutral dragons: Amber \u2022 Jacinth \u2022 Moonstone \u2022 Pearl\nLung dragons: Chiang lung \u2022 Li lung \u2022 Lung wang \u2022 Pan lung \u2022 Shen lung \u2022 T'ien lung \u2022 Tun mi lung \u2022 Yu lung\nPlanar dragons: Adamantine \u2022 Astral \u2022 Battle \u2022 Blight \u2022 Chaos \u2022 Ethereal \u2022 Hellfire wyrm \u2022 Howling \u2022 Mirage \u2022 Oceanus \u2022 Pyroclastic \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rust \u2022 Shadow \u2022 Styx \u2022 Tarterian\nEpic dragons: Force \u2022 Prismatic\nCatastrophic dragons: Earthquake \u2022 Volcanic\nMiscellaneous dragons: Cobra \u2022 Dzalmus \u2022 Mist \u2022 Radiant \u2022 Rattelyr \u2022 Song \u2022 Vishap  ",

        "description": "   A review of white dragon anatomy. White dragons were physically the smallest of the chromatic dragons, even smaller than black dragons. They appeared in shades from white to grey and ice-blue, and in arctic environments, this appearance served as good camouflage.[8] White dragons were physically distinguished by several features: their heads and necks seemed to blend seamlessly into one another, and their wings appeared somewhat frayed along the edges. They had a flap of skin, called a dewlap, lined with spines beneath their chins. Their heads were very streamlined, and they had high crests atop their skulls. They had a crisp, vaguely chemical odor.[citation needed] White dragon toes were spaced more widely than those of other dragons, with barbed claws to aid movement on ice. Their very thin eyelids prevented snowblindness when observing arctic landscapes.[8] When in the stage of being a wyrmling, white dragons had a less pronounced crest and small stubs where their future horns would be. They completely lacked the dewlap and their bodies were protected by a leathery white hide in place of scales.[9] White dragons were not strong combatants as dragons went, but they were not to be underestimated. Their icy breath could freeze an unprepared foe solid in an instant. They typically avoided fights with more powerful dragons, but would avail themselves of any opportunity to take their frustrations out on \"lesser\" creatures.[citation needed] Whites also had exceptional memories,[8] and would often hunt down beings who crossed them, no matter how long it might take.[citation needed] They were not as cruel as black dragons and were not as ferocious as reds, but they were still competent in combat.[8] White dragons preferred to attack first, then eat their prey, rather than pausing to ask questions. They did not often contemplate what to eat, simply choosing the most convenient prey, and would often freeze it after the kill by burying it in snow or ice for days.[8] White dragons expelled a cone of intense cold, a direct hit from which was fatal as it instantly froze its victim. Even a glancing blow could be seriously debilitating.[citation needed] A white dragon nest. They were still powerful enough to overwhelm most humans and had exceptional long-term memories. Adult white dragons had several abilities well suited to their arctic habitat: they could climb ice cliffs with ease, fly very high and fast, and were exceptional swimmers. They loved to swim in cold water; the more frigid, the better. Much of their diet consisted of aquatic creatures, even whales.[8] White dragons were always hungry, and tended to become more savage as they matured. Knowing that they were the smallest and weakest of dragons, many whites harbored inferiority complexes. They took any opportunity to bully beings such as giants and younger dragons of other species.[citation needed] White dragons preferred to scavenge for and collect treasure, rather than involving themselves in politics as other dragons might. Like other dragons, they looked down on others, and tended to view other creatures as prey.[8] Most white dragons laired in ice caves, often dug into the side of an arctic mountain, on tundra, or glacial plains, although they did not need ice and snow, and some settled near mountain peaks or in forests. They could create their own caves by applying the breath weapon to tightly packed snow in order to transform it into solid ice.[8] White dragons made their homes in frozen lands and ice-covered mountains. Their lairs often contained many more tunnels and chambers than those of other chromatic dragons. More powerful white dragons would sometimes turn a large iceberg into a floating lair. Such lairs always had an underwater entrance as well as one to the open air.[citation needed] Whites preferred glittery treasure that resembled ice, such as diamonds or light gems, but platinum, silver, and anything reflective or polished works of art were also popular.[8] Back when her domains included winter, some white dragons were known to worship the Raven Queen.[10] The wyrmling Calcryx in her underground lair near Thundertree. White dragons usually laid about eight or ten eggs in a clutch. A white dragon egg was incubated for fourteen months. The first three and a half months were within the mother's body. On average, between a quarter and a third survived to hatching.[8] White dragon eggs had to be buried in snow or encased in ice while incubating. The parents did not bother to tend or protect the eggs in any way, although they would usually lay them near their lairs. A newly hatched white wyrmling had scales as clear as ice, which became white as the dragon matured. They were expected to survive on their own from the moment they hatched, although some white dragon parents would permit their young to live in their lair until they reached adulthood.[citation needed] The wyrmling developed into a young dragon after about three or four years, and then into an adult after about 100 years. Elder white dragons aged from about 750 years, while ancients aged from 1700 years, and the oldest white dragons lived around 2100 years.[8] A depiction of a white dragon from Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms.
