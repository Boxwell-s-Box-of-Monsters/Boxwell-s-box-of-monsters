    "description": "Giant lizards were much larger than normal lizards and monitor lizards, and as such, were about 15\u202fft (4.6\u202fm) long.[3][4]These creatures did not seem to keep or hoard treasure of any type. They were very quick at traversing land, and much faster than all other types of lizards.[4] Giant lizards were good climbers, and could climb as fast as they crawled.[1] Some of these beasts could hold their breath for up to 15 minutes, as well as climb upside down on ceilings and difficult surfaces.[1]Giant lizards had very large maws, making it able for them to envelop smaller foes.[4]Appearing in pairs or in groups up to twelve, giant lizards preferred to lurk in swamps and marshes.[4] They were also known to be solitary, and could dwell in any warm lands.[3] However, they were sometimes domesticated by lizardfolk who used them as pack animals and a source of food.[3][1]They were somewhat lazy at hunting, and would often attack anything that could be eaten. Giant lizards were known to be hunted upon by black dragons.[3]In northwest Faer\u00fbn, giant lizards could be found in the Stump Bog.[6] Beyond the Prime Material plane, like most mundane animals these creatures could be found in the Beastlands.[7]",
