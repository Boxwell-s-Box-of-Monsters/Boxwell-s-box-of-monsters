    "description": "   The jackal looked something like a mixture of a wild fox and a domestic dog.[2] Like other dogs their size, they were skilled at jumping and tracking by scent.[2][3][1] Jackals, like other small dogs, hunted in packs,[2][3][1] of about one to six animals,[5] but usually, they scavenged for their food.[5] They were not very brave animals and were not typically aggressive.[5] Jackals were known to inhabit the Calim Desert during the time of the city of Cursrah.[6], the Lonely Moor,[7] the land of Amn.[8] and the Raurin desert.[9]",
