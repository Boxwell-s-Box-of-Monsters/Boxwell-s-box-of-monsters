    "description": "   Scorpions typically only attacked other creatures when were disturbed or felt threatened.[2] A scorpion's primary means of offense was its piercing stinger.[1] Scorpions typically lived in hot, dry regions.[2] In the Midwood area of Cormanthor, they were known to make their homes inside of rotting logs.[6] In Anauroch they could be found throughout the Sword and in the Plain of Standing Stones.[7] Some creatures were known to place scorpions inside of containers, such as jars or chests, to act as a sort of trap for would be thieves.[2] Scorpion tails were an ingredient for potions of longevity.[8] Sometime before 1373 DR, the zulkir of Illusion and a Red Wizard Mythrell'aa assassinated a full dinner party of his political opponents by transmuting pastries into vicious scorpions.[9] Sometime before the Year of Lightning Storms, 1374 DR, a famed (and infamous) bard Volothamp Geddarm, discovered a rare species of a scorpion in his boot. This close brush with death was a supremely exciting event for the author.[10] In Zakhara, there were known to be animal cults that centered around the worship of scorpions.[11] Disclaimer: The views expressed in the following links do not necessarily represent the views of the editors of this wiki, nor does any lore presented necessarily adhere to established canon.",
