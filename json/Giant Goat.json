They grew long, sharp horns.[2]When confronting opponents, giant goats mimicked their smaller kin by charging and ramming with their horns.[1][2]Giant goats were rather reclusive.[2]Giant goats were a herbivorous species.[2]These creatures were typically found in hilly regions.[2]Giant goats were known to inhabit the Stonelands,[3] Hartsvale,[4] and Deadstone Cleft.[5]Some creatures were known to domesticate and herd giant goats, such as stone giants.[3]Occasionally giant goats were used as mounts,[6] especially by druids that frequented mountainous regions.[7]A giant goat could be summoned by the conjure animals spell.[8]",
