They had gray or black fur, and on average stood 3 feet (0.9 meters) high and were 5 feet (1.5 meters) long. They weighed around 300 pounds (136 kilograms).[citation needed]\nBehavior\nDespite their higher intelligence and evil traits, worgs tended to act, for the most part, like regular wolves. They often hunted in packs, but sometimes hunted alone. Lone worgs tended to hunt creatures smaller than themselves, while mated pairs and packs hunted larger game. They preferred large, herbivorous animals, usually the young, sick, or weak, but weren't afraid to take humanoids, especially when other prey was scarce.[citation needed]\nCombat\nIn any number, worgs employed similar tactics. They would stalk humanoid prey for a number of hours or even days, choosing the best of time of day and terrain for the attack. When they did, they employed hit-and-run tactics to exhaust a victim, until finally the whole pack went in for the kill. If they outnumbered a victim or were especially impatient, they might try to corner the prey, then attack.[citation needed]\nThey attacked with their teeth. Like a wolf, they could bite their prey and try to bear them down to the ground.[citation needed]\nThey also had the benefit of stealth, keen senses, and the ability to scent prey.[citation needed]\nSociety\nUnlike most animalistic creatures, worgs could speak. They could speak both Common and Goblinoid, as well as a language of their own.[citation needed]\nWorgs of Faer\u00fbn venerated Malar under the named of \"The Great One.\" After worg's death, the Great One led its soul into the unending Great Hunt \u2013 worgs' afterlife.
