    "description": "      Most half-dragons were slightly bigger than their non-dragon parent and displayed features of their dragon parent. These draconic features could be as subtle as serpentine slit pupils, or so prominent that the subject appeared like a dragonborn with wings and tail, their other half virtually undetectable.[citation needed] A half-dragon had the ability to use the breath weapon of its dragon half, though it was not as potent and could not be used as frequently. Half-dragons had low-light vision and darkvision. They also had tinted skin or scales that were of the same color as their dragon parent and helped protect from physical attacks.[2] All half-dragons were immune to sleep and paralysis effects. They also had an additional immunity based of which dragon type they were related to.[2] Blue half-dragon hobgoblins were the first generation result of mating between the dragons of Morueme and their hobgoblin allies.[4]   Dragonbloods: Draconic creature \u2022 Dragonborn of Bahamut \u2022 Dragonspawn\nDrow-dragon (shadow) \u2022 Drow-dragon (deep) \u2022 Half-dragon \u2022 Kobold (Dragonwrought \u2022 Urd) \u2022 Weredragon \u2022 Zar'ithra \u2022 Zekyl\nHybrid monsters: Dracimera \u2022 Mantidrake \u2022 Wyvern drake",
