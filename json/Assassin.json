Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit. If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. The assassin deals an extra 13 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

They were masters at dealing high damage from sneak attacks, and could even poison their weapons without the risk of poisoning themselves. With training, they could deliver stealth attacks that could instantly kill their target. Alternatively, if their target was wanted alive, they had the ability to merely paralyze them, allowing time for them to be tied up, or otherwise restrained.[3]\nProvided they were intelligent enough, assassins also gained a limited amount of magical ability, allowing them to cast some minor arcane spells. The spell effects were generally those that made it easier to approach or kill a target, or those that aided the assassin's escape, if discovered.[3]\nAppendix\nFurther Reading\nMike Mearls (September 2009). \u201cThe Assassin: Heroic Tier\u201d.
