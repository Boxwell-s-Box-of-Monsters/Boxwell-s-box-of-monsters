    "description": "      Plesiosauruses had compact bodies and strong flippers that were used to swim. They had long and flexible necks that accounted for about a third of their length.[1] Plesiosauruses were aggressive predators. They attacked any creature that crossed their path.[1] They were also highly curious and considered to be one of the smartest species of dinosaurs.[2] Plesiosaurs were commonly found in the depths of the Lake of Mists[6] and some dwelled in the Methmere.[7] Beyond the Prime Material plane, some lived within the central lake of the Forbidden Plateau.[8] Sauropods: Anchisaurus \u2022 Brachiosaurus \u2022 Brontosaurus \u2022 Camarasaurus \u2022 Cetiosaurus \u2022 Diplodocus \u2022 Mamenchisaurus \u2022 Massospondylus \u2022 Plateosaurus\nOrnithopods: \u2022 Ankylosaurus \u2022 Camptosaurus \u2022 Dacentrurus \u2022 Hadrosaurus \u2022 Iguanodon \u2022 Kentrosaurus \u2022 Lambeosaurus \u2022 Monoclonius \u2022 Paleocinthus \u2022 Pentaceratops \u2022 Stegosaurus \u2022 Styracosaurus \u2022 Trachodon \u2022 Triceratops\nPterosaurids: Pteranodon \u2022 Pterosaurus \u2022 Quetzalcoatlus\nAquatic: Elasmosaurus \u2022 Mosasaurus \u2022 Nothosaurus \u2022 Plesiosaurus \u2022 Temnodontosaurus",
