    "description": "   Quippers were well adapted to many environments, but typically found in freshwater. It was not uncommon to find schools of quippers even in underground lakes.[1] They were common in rivers throughout Chult[5] and in the headwaters of the Styx in Pandemonium.[8] During the time of Netheril, schools of quippers lived in the southern Channel Lock, but never migrated into the deeper Narrow Sea, the reason unknown.[6] Quipper and chips was a popular dish served at the Yawning Portal in Waterdeep in the 1490s DR.[9]",
