    "description": "A dust mephit was about four feet (120 centimeters) tall and weighed a couple pounds (about one kilogram).[3] They had rough gray skin, which seemed to produce dust and grit constantly as they moved.[2] Like all mephits, dust mephits were impish in appearance and had wispy wings.[3]AD5 Things You Should Never Do With Your Money, According to ExpertsBy The Penny HoarderDust mephits typically seemed sorrowful[3] and irritable.[2]Dust mephits could heal themselves as long as they were in a dusty, dry environment. They had the ability to breathe a conical cloud of irritating particulates, which could cause burning eyes and itching skin in victims. They also had the innate power to surround themselves with a blurring cloud of dust about once every hour or to call forth a powerful wall of roiling dust once per day.[3] They were immune to the effects of fire or poisons.[2]When forced to fight, these mephits were exceptionally persistent and would rarely ever retreat,[2] biting and clawing and injuring opponents with their breath.[3]Dust mephits preferred living in places that were arid, such as deserts or old, abandoned buildings.[2]",
