A Shrine of Myrkul was the part of the family crypt.[7]\nHistory\nHouse Cassalanter was ennobled in the Year of the Cockatrice, 1248 DR when the Lords of Waterdeep recognized several merchant houses and granted them noble titles and seals.[8]\nIn 1368 DR, Cassalanters loaned two ten-million golden lions with a huge interest rate. The first loan was to Widow Silvermane who ran a lottery in the North Ward of Waterdeep, and the second noe went to the Field of Triumph Race Track in the Sea Ward. The astronomical loans were caused by goddess' Tymoras luck going out of control all over the Realms. Every single gambler picked the winning number and winning horses, costing Widow Silvermane and the Field of Triumph disastrous losses.[9]\nIn 1370 DR, a skeleton dressed in Cassalanter family garb was seen attacking several Waterdhavians. These incidents attracted the attention of the city's Lords of Waterdeep. The undead came from the family's old crypt in Undermountain, and a lone hero was sent to investigate the restless Cassalanter ancestors. The hero successfully destroyed the undead and the ghoul necromancer behind the infestation, Ghoulmaster and the noble family offered a hefty reward for the deed.[7]\nIn the late 15th century DR, the Cassalanters faced imminent bankruptcy. In order to prevent it, in 1489 DR[note 1] Ammalia and Victoro struck a deal with the archdevil Asmodeus, trading the souls of their children in exchange for instant financial comeback. Their eldest son, Osvaldo, was taken immediately and transformed into a chain devil, while the younger twins Elzerina and Terenzio were scheduled to be taken on the occasion of their 9th birthday, one tenday after Founders' Day of 1492 DR.[10]\nMembers\n14th century DR\nOhrl Cassalanter: The family's patriarch[2]\nSylull Cassalanter: Lady of House Cassalanter[1]\nPanricon Cassalanter: The eldest son of Ohrl and Sylull[1]\nCaladorn Cassalanter: The third son of the family who forewent his family to embark on adventure and became a Masked Lord of Waterdeep,[11] ascending to the office of Open Lord some time before 1399 DR.[12]\nMyrna Cassalanter:[6]\nErin Cassalanter Dezlentyr:[13]\nThe 15th\u2012century Cassalanters: (left to right) Terenzio, Elzerina, Ammalia, and Victoro.\n15th century DR\nVictoro Cassalanter: Lord of the family.

You can help the Forgotten Realms Wiki by providing more information.\nNotes\n\u2191 Canon material does not provide a year for the events described in Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, but Christopher Perkins answered a question via Twitter and stated the year was 1492 DR. Corroborating this, Dragon Heist page 20 refers to events of Death Masks (set in 1491 DR) as being \"last year\". Unless a canon source contradicts this assertion, this wiki will use 1492 DR for events related to this sourcebook and Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage (which is referenced on pages 5 and 98 of Dragon Heist).\nAppearances\nAdventures\nWaterdeep: Dragon Heist\nNovels\nReferenced only\nTymora's Luck\nVideo Games\nDescent to Undermountain\nGallery\nConcept art of the 15th century Cassalanter family, for Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, by Daarken.\nReferences\n\u2191\n1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 Eric L.
